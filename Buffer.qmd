### Theoretical spectral density of an ARIMA model

old title: Theoretical spectrum of the ARIMA model

In the bottom part the panel [the ARIMA model](../theory/SA_lin.html) used by TRAMO is presented using symbolic notation \\((P,D,Q)(PB,DB,QB)\\). Estimated parameters' coefficients (regular and seasonal AR and MA) are shown in closed form (i.e. using the backshift operator[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-12] \\(B\\)). For each regular AR root (i.e. the solution of the characteristic equation) the [argument and modulus](../theory/SA_SEATS.html#derivation-of-the-models-for-the-components) are given.

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-12]: A backshift operator \\(B \\)is defined as: ($B^{k}x_{t} = x_{t - k})$. It is used to denote lagged series.

**The details of ARIMA model used for modelling**

For each regular AR root the argument and modulus are also reported (if present, i.e. if \\(\mathbf{P > 0}\\)) to inform to which time series component the regular roots would be assigned.
