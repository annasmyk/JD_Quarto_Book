# JDemetra+ {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

JD+ is a library of algorithms for seasonal adjustment and time series econometrics. You can learn more about the history of the project here (link to below)

link to key references - handbooks (3) - sets of guidelines (2 or 3 ?)

## Main functions

### Seasonal adjustment algorithms

All are available for low and high frequency data.

## Structure of this book

This book is divided in four parts, allowing the user to access the resources from different perspectives.

### Algorithms

This part provides a step by step description of all the algorithms featured in JD+, grouped by purpose - seasonal adjustment - benchmarking - temporal disaggregation - ... links

### Tools

JDemetra+ offers 3 kinds of tools - A Graphical User Interface (GUI) which can be enhanced with plug-ins - A set of R packages - A Cruncher for mass production in seasonal adjustment

### Underlying Statistical Methods

This part gives details about the underlying statistical methods to foster a more in-depth understanding of the algorithms.Those methods are described in the light and spirit of their use as building blocks of the algorithms presented above, not aiming at all at their comprehensive coverage.

## How to use this book

### Audience

This book targets the beginner as well as seasoned methodologist interested in using JDemetra+ software for any the purposes listed below.

The documentation is built in layers allowing to skip details and complexity in the first steps
