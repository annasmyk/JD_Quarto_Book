## Motivation

The primary aim of the seasonal adjustment process is to remove seasonal
fluctuations from the time series. To achieve this goal, seasonal
adjustment methods decompose the original time series into components
that capture specific movements. These components are: trend-cycle,
seasonality and irregularity. The trend-cycle component includes
long-term and medium-term movements in the data. For seasonal adjustment
purposes there is no need to divide this component into two parts.
JDemetra+ refers to the trend-cycle as trend and consequently this
convention is used here.

This section presents the options of the seasonal adjustment processes
performed by the methods implemented in JDemetra+
(X-12-ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO/SEATS) and discusses the output
displayed by JDemetra+. As these seasonal adjustment methods use
different approach to the decomposition, the output produced for both of
them has different structure and content. Therefore, the results for
both methods are discussed separately. However, in contrast to the
original programs, in JDemetra+ some quality indicators have been
implemented for both methods, allowing for an easier comparison of the
results.


## Unobserved Components (UC)

The main components, each representing the impact of certain types of
phenomena on the time series ($X_{t}$), are:

-   The trend ($T_{t}$) that captures long-term and medium-term
    behaviour;

-   The seasonal component ($S_{t}$) representing intra-year
    fluctuations, monthly or quarterly, that are repeated more or less
    regularly year after year;

-   The irregular component ($I_{t}$) combining all the other more or
    less erratic fluctuations not covered by the previous components.

In general, the trend consists of 2 sub-components:

-   The long-term evolution of the series;

-   The cycle, that represents the smooth, almost periodic movement
    around the long-term evolution of the series. It reveals a
    succession of phases of growth and recession.

For seasonal adjustment purposes both TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS do
not separate the long-term trend from the cycle as these two components
are usually too short to perform their reliable estimation.
Consequently, hereafter TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS estimate the
trend component. However, the original TRAMO-SEATS may separate the
long-term trend from the cycle through the Hodrick-Precsott filter using
the output of the standard decomposition. It should be remembered that
JDemetra+ refers to the trend-cycle as trend ($T_{t}$), and consequently
this convention is used in this document.

TRAMO-SEATS considers two decomposition models:

-   The additive model: $X_{t} = T_{t} + S_{t} + I_{t}$;

-   The log additive model:
    $log(X_{t}) = log(T_{t}) + log(S_{t}) + log(I_{t})$.

Apart from these two decomposition types X-13ARIMA-SEATS allows the user
to apply also the multiplicative model:
$X_{t} = T_{t} \times S_{t} \times I_{t}$.

A time series $x_{t}$, which is a subject to a decomposition, is assumed
to be a realisation of a discrete-time stochastic, covariance-stationary
linear process, which is a collection of random variables $x_{t}$, where
$t$ denotes time. It can be shown that any stochastic,
covariance-stationary process can be presented in the form:

$x_{t} = \mu_{t} + {\widetilde{x}}_{t}$, $$1$$

where $\mu_{t}$ is a linearly deterministic component and
${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$ is a linearly interderministic component, such as:

$${\widetilde{x}}_{t} = {\sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}\psi_{j}a}_{t - j}
  $$, $$2$$

where $\sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}\psi_{i}^{2} < \infty$ (coefficients
$\psi_{j}$ are absolutely summable), $\psi_{0} = 1$ and $a_{t}$ is the
white noise error with zero mean and constant variance $V_{a}$. The
error term $a_{t}$ represents the one-period ahead forecast error of
$x_{t}$, that is:

$$
  a_{t} = {\widetilde{x}}_{t} - {\widehat{x}}_{t|t - 1}
  $$, $$3$$

where $${\widehat{x}}_{t|t - 1}$$ is the forecast of
$${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$$ made at period $t - 1$. As $a_{t}$ represents
what is new in $${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$$ in point $t$, i.e., not contained
in the past values of $${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$$, it is also called
innovation of the process. From $$3$$ $${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$$ can be
viewed as a linear filter applied to the innovations.

The equation 7.1 is called a Wold representation. It presents a process
as a sum of linearly deterministic component $\mu_{t}$ and linearly
interderministic component $\sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}\psi_{j}a_{t - j}$, the
first one is perfectly predictable once the history of the process
$x_{t - 1}$ is known and the second one is impossible to predict
perfectly. This explains why the stochastic process cannot be perfectly
predicted.

Under suitable conditions $${\widetilde{x}}_{t}$$ can be presented as a
weighted sum of its past values and $a_{t}$, i.e.:

$$
  { {\widetilde{x}}_{t} = \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty}\pi_{j}{\widetilde{x}}_{t - j} + a}_{t}
  $$, $$4$$

In general, for the observed time series, the assumptions concerning the
nature of the process $$1$$ do not hold for various reasons. Firstly,
most observed time series display a mean that cannot be assumed to be
constant due to the presence of a trend and the seasonal movements.
Secondly, the variance of the time series may vary in time. Finally, the
observed time series usually contain outliers, calendar effects and
regression effects, which are treated as deterministic. Therefore, in
practice a prior transformation and an adjustment need to be applied to
the time series. The constant variance is usually achieved through
taking a logarithmic transformation and the correction for the
deterministic effects, while stationarity of the mean is achieved by
applying regular and seasonal differencing. These processes, jointly
referred to as preadjustment or linearization, can be performed with the
TRAMO or RegARIMA models. Besides the linearisation, forecasts and
backcasts of stochastic time series are estimated with the ARIMA model,
allowing for later application of linear filters at both ends of time
series. The estimation performed with these models delivers the
stochastic part of the time series, called the linearised series, which
is assumed to be an output of a linear stochastic
process.[^seasonal-adjustment-1] The deterministic effects are removed
from the time series and used to form the final components.

[^seasonal-adjustment-1]: When the series are non-stationary
    differentiation is performed before the seasonality tests.

In the next step the linearised series is decomposed into its
components. There is a fundamental difference in how this process is
performed in TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS. In TRAMO-SEATS the
decomposition is performed by the SEATS procedure, which follows a so
called ARIMA model based approach. In principle, it aims to derive the
components with statistical models. More information is given in the
[SEATS](../theory/SA_SEATS.html) section. X-13ARIMA-SEATS offers two
algorithms for decomposition: SEATS and X-11. The X-11 algorithm, which
is described in the [X-11 section](../theory/SA_X11.html) section,
decomposes a series by means of linear filters. Finally, in both methods
the final components are derived by the assignment of the deterministic
effects to the stochastic components. Consequently, the role of the
ARIMA models is different in each method. TRAMO-SEATS applies the ARIMA
models both in the preadjustment step and in the decomposition
procedure. On the contrary, when the X-11 algorithm is used for
decomposition, X-13ARIMA-SEATS uses the ARIMA model only in the
preadjustment step. In summary, the decomposition procedure that results
in an estimation of the seasonal component requires prior identification
of the deterministic effects and their removal from the time series.
This is achieved through the linearisation process performed by the
TRAMO and the RegARIMA models, shortly discussed in the [Linearisation
with the TRAMO and RegARIMA models](../theory/SA_lin.html) section.The
linearised series is then decomposed into the stochastic components with
[SEATS](../theory/SA_SEATS.html) or [X-11](../theory/SA_X11.html)
algorithms.
