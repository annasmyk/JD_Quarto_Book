# Seasonal Adjustment {.unnumbered}


using a ws structure 
stand alone with R packages (TS objects or num vectors)

- approach choice: cf tool selection chapter 
- explanations below work for both soltions
- how to read a ws in R also in tool selection

In this chapter frequancies lower than monthly and integer periodocities 
In the HF chpater higher frequencies and non integer periodicities.

## Motivation

The primary aim of the seasonal adjustment process is to remove seasonal fluctuations from the time series.
Seasonal fluctuations are quasi-periodic infra-annual movements. 
They can mask...

\[insert def SA from b_ov\]

- infra annual peridodic numbers 
- no unamigous definititon 
- depends on its practial estimation

## Data frequencies : high and low

Until recently seasonal where designed to tackly monthly frequencies or lower 
in JD+, 
X13- Seats Arima : 2,4,12
Seats : 2,3,4,6,12

For infra monthly data

## Unobserved Components (UC)

The main components, each representing the impact of certain types of phenomena on the time series ($X_{t}$), are:

-   The trend ($T_{t}$) that captures long-term and medium-term behaviour;

-   The seasonal component ($S_{t}$) representing intra-year fluctuations, monthly or quarterly, that are repeated more or less regularly year after year;

-   The irregular component ($I_{t}$) combining all the other more or less erratic fluctuations not covered by the previous components.

In general, the trend consists of 2 sub-components:

-   The long-term evolution of the series;

-   The cycle, that represents the smooth, almost periodic movement around the long-term evolution of the series. It reveals a succession of phases of growth and recession. 
Trend and cycle are not separated in SA alogrithms.

Two decomposition models:

-   The additive model: $X_{t} = T_{t} + S_{t} + I_{t}$;

-   The multiplicatve model:  $X_{t} = T_{t} \times S_{t} \times I_{t}$.

In the Reg-Arima (link) or Tramo(link) modelling the the multplicative model is estimated in logs; $log(X_{t}) = log(T_{t}) + log(S_{t}) + log(I_{t})$; Seats decompostion also relies on logs wheres X-11 decomp operates...


## Detecting seasonal patterns

## Available algoritms 

(link to table)

The two most popular are..


X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Tramo-Seats

Those will be the most detailed in this doc, but there alternative solutions.

#### M-statistics

At the end of the decomposition, X-11 algorithm provides quality mesures of the decomposition called "M statistics": 11 statistics (M1 to M11) and 2 summary indicators (Q et Q-M2). By design (clickable) $0<M_x<3$ and acceptance region is $M_x \leq 1$ Formula for $Q$ (They are based on F-tables)

-   **M1** The relative contribution of the irregular over three months span
-   **M2** The relative contribution of the irregular component to the stationary portion of the variance
-   **M3** The amount of month to month change in the irregular component as compared to the amount of month to month change in the trend-cycle (I/C-ratio)
-   **M5** MCD (Months for Cyclical Dominance): The number of months it takes the change in the trend-cycle to surpass the amount of change in the irregular
-   **M6** The amount of year to year change in the irregular as compared to the amount of year to year change in the seasonal (only valid for 3x5 seasonal filter)
-   **M7** The amount of moving seasonality present relative to the amount of stable seasonality
-   **M8** The size of the fluctuations in the seasonal component throughout the whole series
-   **M9** The average linear movement in the seasonal component throughout the whole series
-   **M10** Same as 8, calculated for recent years only (4 years, N-2 to N-5)
-   **M11** Same as 9, calculated for recent years only

##### Autocorrelations in the irregular

##### Heteroskedasticity

##### Moving seasonality ratios (MSR)

### User-defined parameters

Here is described how to change default values or automatic choices.

#### List

##### General settings

-   **Mode**
    -   check if this option still works, if so add and edit instructions from old page)
    -   if not but button present : explain that the mode is determined in pre-adjustment (function)
-   **Seasonal component**
    -   check if still relevant, idem as above
    -   in v.2.3 if not ticked, S estimated but options on seasonal filter not available
-   **Forecasts horizon**

Length of the forecasts generated by the RegARIMA model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - if set to is set to 0, the X-11 procedure does not use any model-based forecasts but the original X-11 type forecasts for one year. - default value: -1, thus one year from the Arima model

-   **Backcasts horizon**

Length of the backcasts generated by the RegARIMA model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - default value: 0

##### Irregular correction

-   **LSigma**

    -   sets lower sigma (standard deviation) limit used to down-weight the extreme irregular values in the internal seasonal adjustment iterations, learn more here (LINK to M\_ chapter)
    -   values in $[0,Usigma]$
    -   default value is 1.5

-   **USigma**

    -   sets upper sigma (standard deviation)
    -   values in $[Lsigma,+\infty]$
    -   default value is 2.5

-   **Calendarsigma**

    -   allows to set different **LSigma** and **USigma** for each period
    -   values
        -   None (default)
        -   All: standard errors used for the extreme values detection and adjustment computed separately for each calendar month/quarter
        -   Signif: groups determined by cochran test (check)
        -   Sigmavec: set two customized groups of periods

-   **Excludeforecasts**

    -   ticked : forecasts and backcasts from the RegARIMA model not used in Irregular Correction
    -   unticked (default): forecasts and backcasts used

##### Seasonality extraction filters choice

Specifies which be used to estimate the seasonal factors for the entire series (link to relevant part in M chapter):

-   **Seasonal filter**

-   default value: *MSR* (Moving seasonality ratio), automatic choice of final seasonal filter (cf msr defintion and decison table: link ), initial filters are computed with $3\times 3$

-   choices : $3\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $3\times 5$, $3\times 9$, $3\times 15$ or Stable

-   "Stable" : constat factor for each calendar period (simple moving average of all $S+I$ values for each period)

User choices will be applied to all steps or only to final phase D step.

The seasonal filters can be selected for the entire series, or for a particular month or quarter.

-   **Details on seasonal filters**

Sets different seasonal filters by period in order to account for seasonal heteroskedasticity (link to M chapter)

-   default value: empty

##### Trend estimation filters

-   **Automatic Henderson filter** our user-defined

    -   default: length 13
    -   unticked: user defined length choice

-   **Henderson filter** length choice

    -   values: odd number in $[3,101]$
    -   default value: 13

Check: will user choice be applied to all steps or only to final phase D step

All the parameters above can be set with the specification (link to general explanations) box

#### Parameter setting in R packages

In R, to implement any param change, it is required to retrieve current spec, modify it and apply it again (see T R packages chapter for details). (specific link)
