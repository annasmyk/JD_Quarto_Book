# Outlier detection and external regressors {.unnumbered}


## Chapter's overview

The chapter describes 

- how to generate useful external regressors for improving seasonal adjustment or reg-arima modelling

- JDemetra+ solutions for outlier detection and in a time series.  
These routines can be used stand alone or as part of a seasonal adjustment process. They can be accessed via GUI or R packages.

How to use the generated regressors, or any user-defined variable, in a seasonal adjustment or reg-arima modelling process is discussed in the relevant chapters on [SA](A-sa.qmd) and [SA of High-frequency data](A-sa-hf.qmd). There you will also find out how to fix the corresponding coefficients and how to allocate the effects to the selected component.

The external regressors described below are not meant for calendar correction which is detailed [here](A-calendar-correction.qmd)

## Generating external regressors

### Outliers

#### Outlier Types

The following outliers are available for automatic detection

ADD:
- specifics for HF data (wo outiler)


#### Pre-specifying outliers 

Outliers are well-defined types of auxiliary variables, therefore when they are used (reg-arima or tramo modelling) they don't need to be explicitly generated beforehand. Pre-specifying outliers is detailed in chapters on [SA](A-sa.qmd) and [SA of High-frequency data](A-sa-hf.qmd). 

ADD: 

- in v2 fixing coefficients impossible (window displayed as a calendar)

- in v3 calendar window  or different window, allowing to fix coefficients

#### Generating regressors for outliers

Nevertheless, explicit regressors corresponding to outliers can be generated with `rjd3toolkit` functions for independent use. Further details rjd3toolkit help pages.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#Outliers in February 2002, for monthly data
library("rjd3toolkit")
ao <- ao_variable(frequency=12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, date = "2002-02-01")
ls <- ls_variable(12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, date = "2002-02-01")
tc <- tc_variable(12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, date = "2002-02-01")
so <- so_variable(12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, date = "2002-02-01")

```
 

### Ramps

A ramp effect means a linear increase or decrease in the level of the series over a specified time interval $t_{0}$ to $\ t_{1}$. Ramps can overlap other ramps, additive outliers and level shifts. In seasonal adjustment their effected will be allocated to the trend.

Adding ramps to a seasonal adjustment (or reg-arima/tramo) specification happens in one step in GUI as well as in R, where ramp regressors can nevertheless be independently generated.


#### Adding ramps in GUI 

In the specification window

![](All_images/SA_REGA_user_def_regs_ramps_definition.png)

The effect of the ramps is stored in reg_t pre-adjustment series. 

#### Adding ramps in R 

Use the function `add_ramp`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create a specification from a default specification 
init_spec <- rjd3x13::spec_x13("RSA5c")

# add ramp on year 2012
new_spec <- rjd3toolkit::add_ramp(init_spec,start="2012-01-01",end="2012-12-01")

```


#### Generating ramp regressors in R

Use `ramp_variable` function in rjd3toolkit:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?ramp_variable
# Ramp variable from January 2001 to September 2001 for a monthly series 
rp <- ramp_variable(frequency=12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, range = c(13, 21))
# Or equivalently
rp <- ramp_variable(12, c(2000,1), length = 12*4, range = c("2001-01-01", "2001-09-02"))
plot.ts(rp)

```

### Intervention variables

Intervention variables are modelled as any possible sequence of ones and zeros, on which differencing (regular and seasonal) can be applied.

Adding intervention variables to a seasonal adjustment (or reg-arima/tramo) specification happens in one step when using the GUI, whereas two steps are required in R: generating the regressors and the adding them as an user-defined variable.

#### Generating intervention variables in R 

Using `intervention_variable` function in rjd3toolkit

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library("rjd3toolkit")
? intervention_variable
iv<-intervention_variable(frequency=12, start=c(2000, 1), length=60,
                      starts = "2001-01-01", ends = "2001-12-01")
iv
plot(iv)

iv<-intervention_variable(12, c(2000, 1), 60,
                      starts = "2001-01-01", ends = "2001-12-01", delta = 1)
iv
plot(iv)

iv<-intervention_variable(12, c(2000, 1), 60,
                          starts = "2001-01-01", ends = "2001-12-01",
                          delta =0, seasonaldelta=1)
iv
plot(iv)
```
More details rjd3toolkit help pages.


#### Adding intervention variables in R

Intervention variables can be added to a specification like any other external regressor using the `add_usrdefvar`. They also need to be declared in a "context" using the `modelling_context` function.


```{r,eval=FALSE}
# creating one or several external regressors (TS objects),
# which will be gathered in one or several groups
iv1<-intervention_variable(12, c(2000, 1), 60,
starts = "2001-01-01", ends = "2001-12-01")
iv2<- intervention_variable(12, c(2000, 1), 60,
starts = "2001-01-01", ends = "2001-12-01", delta = 1)
# regressors as a list of two groups (lists) reg1 and reg2
vars<-list(reg1=list(iv1 = iv1),reg2=list(iv2 = iv2) )
# to use those regressors, input : name=reg1.iv1 and name=reg2.iv2 in add_usrdefvar function
# creating the modelling context
my_context<-modelling_context(variables=vars)
# customize a default specification
init_spec <- rjd3x13::spec_x13("RSA5c")
# regressors have to be added one by one
new_spec<- add_usrdefvar(init_spec,name= "reg1.iv1", regeffect="Trend")
new spec<- add_usrdefvar(new_spec,name = "reg2.iv2", regeffect="Trend", coef=0.7)
# modelling context is needed for the estimation phase
# raw series 
y<-rjd3toolkit::ABS$X0.2.09.10.M
sa_x13<- rjd3x13::x13(y, new_spec, context = my_context)

```

### Periodic dummies and contrasts

#### Generating regressors in R

dummies :as many time series as type of periods in a year (4,12)
```{r, eval= FALSE}
## periodic dummies : add explanations and examples
p<-periodic.dummies(4, c(2000,1), 60)
head(p)
class(p)
q<-periodic.contrasts(4, c(2000,1), 60)
q[1:9,]
```


### Trigonometric variables 

Correction for stable seasonality.

#### Generating in R

## Outlier Detection

### With Reg Arima models

#### Within an SA processing

In a seasonal adjustment estimation or reg-arima modelling outliers are detected by default. This process can be customized by selecting the type of outliers to be taken into account and the critical values to be used for selection. See the relevant chapters on [SA](A-sa.qmd) and [SA of High-frequency data](A-sa-hf.qmd)

#### Stand alone 

R packages rjd3x13 and rjd3tramoseats provide functions for detecting outlier with reg-arima (tramo) algorithms. 

using `regarima_outliers`in rjd3x13:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
?regarima_outliers
regarima_outliers(rjd3toolkit::ABS$X0.2.09.10.M, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1), 
                  mean=F,
                  X=NULL, X.td=NULL, 
                  ao=T, ls=F, tc=T, so=T, cv=4)

```
