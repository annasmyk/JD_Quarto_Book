# RegArima (Tramo) Modelling {#a-reg-a .unnumbered}

## In this chapter

This chapter focuses on practical implementation of modelling of a time series (with arima residuals) for low frequency data. High-Frequency (infra monthly) data modelling and seasonal adjustment process are described [here](#a-sa-hf).

The sections below will describe modelling features which can be used stand alone or as [pre-treatment](#sa-pre-t) (first step of [seasonal adjustment](#sa-overview)).

Details on specifications and output characteristics are provided in the [pre-treatment chapter](#sa-pre-t) as they relate to the same procedure.

In-depth methodological explanations of the algorithms are covered in separated chapters, in the [Methods](#part-M) part.

## Modelling Algorithms

| Algorithm        | Access in GUI | Access in R (v2)    | Access in R (v3) |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Reg-Arima        | ✔️            | RJDemetra           | rjd3x13          |
| Tramo            | ✔️            | RJDemetra           | rjd3tramoseats   |
| Extended Airline | ✔️ (v3 only)  | ✖                   | rjd3highfreq     |
| STS              | ✔️ (v3 only)  | rjdsts (deprecated) | rjd3sts          |

Steps to use Reg-Arima and Tramo in a pre-treatment context are described [here](#sa-pre-t). Options and outputs are the same as when modelling is done as pre-treatment or stand alone. Specification differ slightly and the possibility of saving parameters and generating output in the GUI is also different.

[Extended Airline Model](#a-sa-hf) allows to handle infra monthly series in a restricted reg-Arima framework, more details [here](#a-sa-hf).

[Structural time series (STS)](#a-sa-bsm) allow another kind of modelling using state space framework, more details [here](#a-sa-bsm).

## Practical Reg-Arima modelling

For the user not needing seasonal adjustment, the sections below highlight the functions or steps allowing to perform reg-Arima (or Tramo) as a stand alone goal, outside of a seasonal adjustment process.

### In R

In version 2

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RJDemetra")
# Reg-Arima
regA_v2 <- RJDemetra::regarima_x13(raw_series, spec = "RG5c")
# Tramo
tramo_v2 <- RJDemetra::regarima_tramoseats(raw_series,spec = "TRfull")
```

Full documentation of 'RJDemetra::regarima' function can be found [here](https://jdemetra.github.io/rjdemetra/reference/regarima.html)

Full documentation of 'RJDemetra::regarima_tramoseats' function can be found [here](https://jdemetra.github.io/rjdemetra/reference/regarima.html)

In version 3

```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Reg-Arima
sa_regarima_v3 <- rjd3x13::regarima(raw_series, spec = "RG5c")

#Tramo
sa_tramo_v3 <- rjd3tramoseats::tramo(raw_series, spec = "TRfull")

```

Full documentation of 'rjd3x13::regarima' function can be found [here](https://rjdemetra.github.io/rjd3x13/reference/regarima.html)

Full documentation of 'rjd3tramoseats::tramo' function can be found [here](https://rjdemetra.github.io/rjd3tramoseats/reference/tramo.html)

### GUI

In the graphical user interface modelling algorithms can be accessed in two ways described below. In both cases a document (xml file) will be generated and can be save in the workspace. The output (series, parameters and diagnostics) cannot be exported as files, just directly copied from the interface. Further details on window structure in GUI are available [here](#t-gui-sa).
