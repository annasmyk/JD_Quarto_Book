## In this chapter

This chapter focuses on practical implementation of a SEATS decomposition using the graphical user interface [GUI](#tools-GUI) and R using [R packages](#t-r-packs) in version 2.x and 3.x. More explanations on SEATS algorithm can be found [here](#m-seats).

In recent years SEATS has been tailored in JDemetra+ to handle high-frequency (infra-monthly) data, which is described [here](#sa-hf) with more methodological details [here](#m-sa-hf).

The sections below will describe

-   [specifications](#a-sa-SEATS-default-specs) needed to run SEATS 

-   generated output

-   [series](#a-sa-SEATS-out-series)

-   [diagnostics](#a-sa-SEATS-diags)

-   [final parameters](#a-sa-SEATS-final-p)

-   [user-defined parameters](#a-sa-SEATS-user-def)

## Context

SEATS is the second (decomposition) step in a seasonal adjustment processing with [Tramo-Seats](#sa-overview), once a [pre-treatment with Tramo](#sa-pre-t) has been performed. SEATS is an [Arima Model Based (AMB)](#m-seats) algorithm and will decompose the linearized series using the arima model fit in Tramo.

## Tools for Seats decomposition

| Algorithm   | Access in GUI | Access in R (v2) | Access in R v3 |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Tramo-Seats | ✔️            | RJDemetra        | rjd3tramoseats |
| Tramo only  | ✔️            | RJDemetra        | rjd3tramoseats |

Available frequencies in version 2 and version 3


| Version | GUI and R          |
|---------|--------------------|
| v 2.x   | $p=12, 6, 4, 2$    |
| v 3.x   | $p=12, 6, 4, 3, 2$ |

## SEATS Decomposition

[SEATS algorithm](M-SEATS-decomposition.qmd) will decompose the linearized series, in level or in logarithm, using the Arima model fitted by Tramo in the pre-treatment phase.

## Default specifications {#a-sa-SEATS-default-specs}

The default specifications for SEATS must be chosen at the starting of the SA processing. They are detailed in the [Tramo](#sa-pre-t-ts-specs)

## Quick Launch

### From GUI

-   series

-   diagnostics

-   final parameters

-   user-defined parameters

### Default specifications

The default specifications for SEATS must be chosen at the starting of the SA processing. They are detailed in the [Reg-ARIMA part](A-sa.qmd#Pre-treatment:%20Reg-ARIMA%20(or%20TRAMO)) Starting point for TRAMO-SEATS

### Quick Launch


With a workspace open, an SAProcessing created and open data provider:

-   choose a default specification (link)

-   drop your data and press green arrow (link)

### In R

#### In version 2 using [RJDemetra](https://jdemetra.github.io/rjdemetra/)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RJDemetra")
# the input series has to be a Time Series (TS) object
# specification RSAfull including pre-treatment
model_sa_v2 <- tramoseats(raw_series, spec = "RSAfull")
```

Full documentation of 'RJDemetra::tramoseats' function can be found [here](https://jdemetra.github.io/rjdemetra/reference/tramoseats.html)

The model_sa_v2 R object (list of lists) contains all parameters and results. Its structure is detailed [here](#t-r-packs-rjdv2-structure). It can be printed giving access to selected parameters, series and diagnostics.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print(model_sa_v2)
```

#### In version 3 using [rjd3tramoseats](https://rjdemetra.github.io/rjd3tramoseats/)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("rjd3tramoseats")
model_sa_v3 <- tramoseats(raw_series, spec = "RSAfull")
# the input series has to be a Time Series (TS) object
```

Full documentation of 'rjd3tramoseats::tramoseats' function can be found [here](https://rjdemetra.github.io/rjd3tramoseats/reference/tramoseats.html).

The model_sa_v3 R object (list of lists) contains all parameters and results. Its structure is detailed [here](#t-r-packs-rjd3tramoseats-structure).

It can be printed giving access to selected parameters, series and diagnostics.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print(model_sa_v3)
```

### Retrieve Series {#a-sa-SEATS-out-series}
