### Overview of Calendar effects in JDemetra

edit : this has a evolved a lot with v3
definition possibilities via GUI and R have to be re described 

The following description of the calendar effects in JDemetra+ is
strictly based on PALATE, J. (2014).

A natural way for modelling calendar effects consists of distributing
the days of each period into different groups. The regression variable
corresponding to a type of day (a group) is simply defined by the number
of days it contains for each period. Usual classifications are:

-   Trading days (7 groups): each day of the week defines a group
    (Mondays,\...,Sundays);

-   Working days (2 groups): week days and weekends.

The definition of a group could involve partial days. For instance, we
could consider that one half of Saturdays belong to week days and the
second half to weekends.

Usually, specific holidays are handled as Sundays and they are included
in the group corresponding to \"non-working days\". This approach
assumes that the economic activity on national holidays is the same (or
very close to) the level of activity that is typical for Sundays.
Alternatively, specific holidays can be considered separately, e.g. by
the specification that divided days into three groups:

-   Working days (Mondays to Fridays, except for specific holidays),

-   Non-working days (Saturdays and Sundays, except for specific
    holidays),

-   Specific holidays.

### Summary of the method used in JDemetra+ to compute trading day and working day effects

The computation of trading day and working days effects is performed in
four steps:

1.  Computation of the number of each weekday performed for all periods.

2.  Calculation of the usual contrast variables for trading day and
    working day.

3.  Correction of the contrast variables with specific holidays (for
    each holiday add +1 to the number of Sundays and subtract 1 from the
    number of days of the holiday). The correction is not performed if
    the holiday falls on a Sunday, taking into account the validity
    period of the holiday.

4.  Correction of the constant variables for long term mean effects,
    > taking into account the validity period of the holiday; see below
    > for the different cases.

The corrections of the constant variables may receive a weight
corresponding to the part of the holiday considered as a Sunday.

An example below illustrates the application of the above algorithm for
the hypothetical country in which three holidays are celebrated:

-   New Year (a fixed holiday, celebrated on 01 January);

-   Shrove Tuesday (a moving holiday, which falls 47 days before Easter
    Sunday, celebrated until the end of 2012);

-   Freedom day (a fixed holiday, celebrated on 25 April).

The consecutive steps in calculation of the calendar for 2012 and 2013
years are explained below.

First, the number of each day of the week in the given month is
calculated as it is shown in table below.

the linear transformation applied to the variables presented in table below.

In the next step the corrections for holidays is done in the following
way:

-   New Year: In 2012 it falls on a Sunday. Therefore no correction is
    applied. In 2013 it falls on a Tuesday. Consequently, the following
    corrections are applied to the number of each weekday in January:
    Tuesday -1, Sunday +1, so the following corrections are applied to
    the contrast variables: -2 for Tuesday and -1 for the other contrast
    variables.

-   Shrove Tuesday: It is a fixed day of the week holiday that always
    falls on Tuesday. For this reason in 2012 the following corrections
    are applied to the number of each weekday in February: Tuesday -1,
    Sunday +1, so the following corrections are applied to the contrast
    variables: -2 for the contrast variable associated with Tuesday,
    and -1 for the other contrast variables. The holiday expires at the
    end of 2012. Therefore no corrections are made for 2013.

-   Freedom Day: In 2012 it falls on a Wednesday. Consequently, the
    following corrections are applied to the number of each weekday in
    April: Wednesday -1, Sunday +1, so the following corrections are
    applied to the contrast variables: -2 for Wednesday and -1 for the
    other contrast variables. In 2013 it falls on Thursday. Therefore,
    the following corrections are applied to the number of each weekday
    in April: Thursday -1, Sunday +1, so the following corrections are
    applied to the contrast variables: -2 for Thursday, and -1 for the
    other contrast variables.

The result of these corrections is presented in table below.

Finally, the long term corrections are applied on each year of the
validity period of the holiday.

-   New Year: Correction on the contrasts: +1, to be applied to January
    of 2012 and 2013.

-   Shrove Tuesday: It may fall either in February or in March. It will
    fall in March if Easter is on or after 17 April. Taking into account
    the theoretical distribution of Easter, it gives: prob(March) =
    +0.22147, prob(February) = +0.77853. The correction of the contrasts
    will be +1.55707 for Tuesday in February 2012 and +0.77853 for the
    other contrast variables. The correction of the contrasts will be
    +0.44293 for Tuesday in March 2012, +0.22147 for the other contrast
    variables.

-   Freedom Day: Correction on the contrasts: +1, to be applied to April
    of 2012 and 2013.

The modifications due to the corrections described above are presented
in table below.

### Mean and seasonal effects of calendar variables

The calendar effects produced by the regression variables that fulfil
the definition presented above include a mean effect (i.e. an effect
that is independent of the period) and a seasonal effect (i.e. an effect
that is dependent of the period and on average it is equal to 0). Such
an outcome is inappropriate, as in the usual decomposition of a series
the mean effect should be allocated to the trend component and the fixed
seasonal effect should be affected to the corresponding component.
Therefore, the actual calendar effect should only contain effects that
don\'t belong to the other components.

In the context of JDemetra+ the mean effect and the seasonal effect are
long term theoretical effects rather than the effects computed on the
time span of the considered series (which should be continuously
revised).

The mean effect of a calendar variable is the average number of days in
its group. Taking into account that one year has on average 365.25 days,
the monthly mean effects for a working days are, as shown in the table below,
21.7411 for week days and 8.696 for weekends.

**Monthly mean effects for the Working day variable**

 
 |**Groups of Working day effect**|   **Mean effect**            |
 |--------------------------------|------------------------------|
 |Week days                       |  365.25/12\*5/7 = **21.7411**|
 |Weekends                        |  365.25/12\*2/7 = **8.696**  |
 |Total                           | 365.25/12 = **30.4375**      |

The number of days by period is highly seasonal, as apart from
February, the length of each month is the same every year. For this
reason, any set of calendar variables will contain, at least in some
variables, a significant seasonal effect, which is defined as the
average number of days by period (Januaries\..., first quarters\...)
outside the mean effect. Removing that fixed seasonal effects consists
of removing for each period the long term average of days that belong to
it. The calculation of a seasonal effect for the working days
classification is presented in the table below.

**The mean effect and the seasonal effect for the calendar periods**

 
  |**Period**   |**Average number of days**   |**Average number of week days**   |**Mean effect**   |**Seasonal effect** |

For a given time span, the actual calendar effect for week days can be
easily calculated as the difference between the number of week days in a
specific period and the sum of the mean effect and the seasonal effect
assigned to this period, as it is shown in the table below for the period
01.2013 -- 06.2013.

**The calendar effect for the period 01.2013 - 06.2013**

  |May-2013              |23              |21.7411           |0.4018                |0.8571|
  |Jun-2013              |20              |21.7411           |-0.3125               |-1.4286|

The distinction between the mean effect and the seasonal effect is
usually unnecessary. Those effects can be considered together (simply
called mean effects) and be computed by removing from each calendar
variable its average number of days by period. These global means effect
are considered in the next section.

### Impact of the mean effects on the decomposition

When the ARIMA model contains a seasonal difference -- something that
should always happen with calendar variables -- the mean effects
contained in the calendar variables are automatically eliminated, so
that they don\'t modify the estimation. The model is indeed estimated on
the series/regression variables after differencing. However, they lead
to a different linearised series ($y_{\text{lin}})$. The impact of other
corrections (mean and/or fixed seasonal) on the decomposition is
presented in the next paragraph. Such corrections could be obtained, for
instance, by applying other solutions for the long term corrections or
by computing them on the time span of the series.

Now the model with \"correct\" calendar effects (denoted as $C$), i.e.
effects without mean and fixed seasonal effects, can be considered. To
simplify the problem, the model has no other regression effects.

For such a model the following relations hold:

$$y_{\text{lin}} = \ y - C$$                       
$$T = \ F_{T}\left( y_{\text{lin}} \right)$$       
$$S = \ F_{S}\left( y_{\text{lin}} \right) + C$$   
$$I = \ F_{I}\left( y_{\text{lin}} \right)$$       

where:

T - the trend;

S - the seasonal component;

I - the irregular component;

$F_{X}$ - the linear filter for the component X.

Consider next other calendar effects ($\widetilde{C}$) that contain some
mean ($\text{cm}$, integrated to the final trend) and fixed seasonal
effects ($\text{cs}$, integrated to the final seasonal). The modified
equations are now:

  $$\widetilde{C} = C + cm + cs$$                                                       
  $${\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} = \ y - \widetilde{C} = \ y_{\text{lin}} - cm - cs$$   
  $$\widetilde{T} = \ F_{T}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) + cm$$           
  $$\widetilde{S} = \ F_{S}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) + C + cs$$       
  $$\widetilde{I} = \ F_{I}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right)$$                

Taking into account that $F_{X}$ is a linear transformation and
that[^64]

  $$F_{T}\left( \text{cm} \right) = cm$$   
  $$F_{T}\left( \text{cs} \right) = 0$$     
  $$F_{S}\left( \text{cm} \right) = 0\ $$   
  $$F_{S}\left( \text{cs} \right) = cs$$    
  $$F_{I}\left( \text{cm} \right) = 0$$     
  $$F_{I}\left( \text{cs} \right) = 0$$     

The following relationships hold:

  $$\widetilde{T} = \ F_{T}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) + cm = F_{T}\left( y_{\text{lin}} \right) - cm + cm = T$$           
  $$\widetilde{S} = \ F_{S}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) + C + cs = F_{S}\left( y_{\text{lin}} \right) - cs + C + cs = S$$   
  $$\widetilde{I} = \ I$$                                                                                                                 

If we don't take into account the effects and apply the same approach
as in the "correct" calendar effects, we will get:

  $$\breve{T} = \ F_{T}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) = T - cm$$                   
  $$\breve{S} = \ F_{S}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) + \widetilde{C} = S + cm$$   
  $$\breve{I} = \ F_{I}\left( {\widetilde{y}}_{\text{lin}} \right) = I$$                        

The trend, seasonal and seasonally adjusted series will only differ by a
(usually small) constant.

In summary, the decomposition does not depend on the mean and fixed
seasonal effects used for the calendar effects, provided that those
effects are integrated in the corresponding final components. If these
corrections are not taken into account, the main series of the
decomposition will only differ by a constant.


[^64]: In case of SEATS the properties can be trivially derived from the matrix formulation of signal extraction. They are also valid for X-11 (additive).


### Linear transformations of the calendar variables



As far as the RegARIMA and the TRAMO models are considered, any
non-degenerated linear transformation of the calendar variables can be
used. It will produce the same results (likelihood, residuals,
parameters, joint effect of the calendar variables, joint F-test on the
coefficients of the calendar variables...). The linearised series that
will be further decomposed is invariant to any linear transformation of
the calendar variables.

However, it should be mentioned that choices of calendar corrections
based on the tests on the individual t statistics are dependent on the
transformation, which is rather arbitrary. This is the case in old
versions of TRAMO-SEATS. That is why the joint F-test (as in the version
of TRAMO-SEATS implemented in TSW+) should be preferred.

An example of a linear transformation is the calculation of the contrast
variables. In the case of the usual trading day variables, they are
defined by the following transformation: the 6 contrast variables
($\text{No.}\left( \text{Mondays} \right) - No.\left( \text{Sundays} \right),\ldots No.\left( \text{Saturdays} \right) - No.(Sundays)$)
used with the length of period.


  $$\begin{bmatrix}                 
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\    
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\    
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\    
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & - 1 \\    
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & - 1 \\    
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & - 1 \\    
  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\      
  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}      
  \text{Mon} \\                     
  \text{Tue} \\                     
  \text{Wed} \\                     
  \text{Thu} \\                     
  \text{Fri} \\                     
  \text{Sat} \\                     
  \text{Sun} \\                     
  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}   
  Mon - Sun \\                      
  Tue - Sun \\                      
  Wed - Sun \\                      
  Thu - Sun \\                      
  Fri - Sun \\                      
  Sat - Sun \\                      
  \text{Length of period} \\      
  \end{bmatrix}$$                   
  
For the usual working day variables, two variables are used: one
contrast variable and the length of period

  $$\begin{bmatrix}                  
  1 & - \frac{5}{2} \\              
  1 & 1 \\                          
  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}      
  \text{Week} \\                    
  \text{Weekend} \\                 
  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}   
  \text{Contrast week} \\          
  \text{Length of period} \\      
  \end{bmatrix}$$

The $\text{Length of period}$ variable is defined as a deviation from
the length of the month (in days) and the average month length, which is
equal to $30.4375.$ Instead, the leap-year variable can be used here
(see Regression sections in [RegARIMA](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#regression) or 
[Tramo](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression))[^62].

Such transformations have several advantages. They suppress from the
contrast variables the mean and the seasonal effects, which are
concentrated in the last variable. So, they lead to fewer correlated
variables, which are more appropriate to be included in the regression
model. The sum of the effects of each day of the week estimated with the
trading (working) day contrast variables cancel out.

### Handling of specific holidays

check vs GUI (v3) and rjd3 modelling



Three types of holidays are implemented in JDemetra+:

-   Fixed days, corresponding to the fixed dates in the year (e.g. New
    Year, Christmas).

-   Easter related days, corresponding to the days that are defined in
    relation to Easter (e.g. Easter +/- n days; example: Ascension,
    Pentecost).

-   Fixed week days, corresponding to the fixed days in a given week of
    a given month (e.g. Labor Day celebrated in the USA on the first
    Monday of September).

From a conceptual point of view, specific holidays are handled in
exactly the same way as the other days. It should be decided, however,
to which group of days they belong. Usually they are handled as Sundays.
This convention is also used in JDemetra+. Therefore, except if the
holiday falls on a Sunday, the appearance of a holiday leads to
correction in two groups, i.e. in the group that contains the weekday,
in which holiday falls, and the group that contains the Sundays.

Country specific holidays have an impact on the mean and the seasonal
effects of calendar effects. Therefore, the appropriate corrections to
the number of particular days (which are usually the basis for the
definition of other calendar variables) should be applied, following the
kind of holidays. These corrections are applied to the period(s) that
may contain the holiday. The long term corrections in JDemetra+ don\'t
take into account the fact that some moving holidays could fall on the
same day (for instance the May Day and the Ascension). However, those
events are exceptional, and their impact on the final result is usually
not significant.

#### Fixed day

The probability that the holiday falls on a given day of the week is
1/7. Therefore, the probability to have 1 day more that is treated like
Sunday is 6/7. The effect on the means for the period that contains the
fixed day is presented in the table below (the correction on the calendar
effect has the opposite sign).

**The effect of the fixed holiday on the period, in which it occurred**


  | **Sundays** |  **Others days**  | **Contrast variables** |
  |-------------| ----------------- |------------------------|
  |+ 6/7        |- 1/7              | 1/7 - (+ 6/7)= -1      |

#### Easter related days

Easter related days always fall the same week day (denoted as Y in the table below: The effects of the Easter Sunday on the seasonal means). However, they can fall during different periods (months or
quarters). Suppose that, taking into account the distribution of the
dates for Easter and the fact that this holiday falls in one of two
periods, the probability that Easter falls during the period
$m$ is $p$, which implies that the probability that it falls in
the period $m + 1$ is $1 - p$. The effects of Easter on the seasonal
means are presented in the table below.

**The effects of the Easter Sunday on the seasonal means**


  |**Period**  | **Sundays**   **Days X**   **Others days**   **Contrast Y**      **Other contrasts**
  |------------| ------------- ------------ ----------------- ------------------- ---------------------
  |m            |\+ p          \- p         0                 \- 2p               \- p
  |m+1        |  \+ (1-p)      \- (1-p)     0                 \- 2$\times$(1-p)   \- (1-p)

The distribution of the dates for Easter may be approximated in
different ways. One of the solutions consists of using some well-known
algorithms for computing Easter on a very long period. JDemetra+
provides the Meeus/Jones/Butcher\'s and the Ron Mallen\'s algorithms
(they are identical till year 4100, but they slightly differ after that
date). Another approach consists in deriving a raw theoretical
distribution based on the definition of Easter. It is the solution used
for Easter related days. It is shortly explained below.

The date of Easter in the given year is the first Sunday after the full
moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the northern hemisphere\'s vernal
equinox. The definition is influenced by the Christian tradition,
according to which the equinox is reckoned to be on 21 March[^63] and
the full moon is not necessarily the astronomically correct date.
However, when the full moon falls on Sunday, then Easter is delayed by
one week. With this definition, the date of Easter Sunday varies between
22 March and 25 April. Taking into account that an average lunar month
is $29.530595$ days the approximated distribution of Easter can be
derived. These calculations do not take into account the actual
ecclesiastical moon calendar.

For example, the probability that Easter Sunday falls on 25 March is
0.004838 and results from the facts that the probability that 25 March
falls on a Sunday is $1/7$ and the probability that the full moon is on
21 March, 22 March, 23 March or 24 March is $5/29.53059$. The
probability that Easter falls on 24 April is 0.01708 and results from
the fact that the probability that 24 April is Sunday is $1/7$ and takes
into account that 18 April is the last acceptable date for the full
moon. Therefore the probability that the full moon is on 16 April or 17
April is $1/29.53059$ and the probability that the full moon is on 18
April is $1.53059/29.53059$.

#### Fixed week days

Fixed week days always fall on the same week day (denoted as Y in the table below) and in the same period. Their effect on the seasonal means is
presented in the table below.

**The effect of the fixed week holiday on the period, in which
it occurred**


  |**Sundays**  | **Day Y**   |**Others days**|
  |-------------| ----------- |-----------------|
  |+ 1          |- 1          | 0|

The impact of fixed week days on the regression variables is zero
because the effect itself is compensated by the correction for the mean
effect.

### Holidays with a validity period

When a holiday is valid only for a given time span, JDemetra+ applies
the long term mean corrections only on the corresponding period.
However, those corrections are computed in the same way as in the
general case.

It is important to note that using or not using mean corrections will
impact in the estimation of the RegARIMA and TRAMO models. Indeed, the
mean corrections do not disappear after differencing. The differences
between the SA series computed with or without mean corrections will no
longer be constant.

    on 20 March in most years.



### Different Kinds of calendars

see link with GUI 

This scenario presents how to define different kinds of calendars. These
calendars can be applied to the specifications that take into account
country-specific holidays and can be used for detecting and estimating
the calendar effects.

The calendar effects are those parts of the movements in the time series
that are caused by different number of weekdays in calendar months (or
quarters). They arise as the number of occurrences of each day of the
week in a month (or a quarter) differs from year to year. These
differences cause regular effects in some series. In particular, such
variation is caused by a leap year effect because of an extra day
inserted into February every four years. As with seasonal effects, it is
desirable to estimate and remove calendar effects from the time series.

The calendar effects can be divided into a mean effect, a seasonal part
and a structural part. The mean effect is independent from the period
and therefore should be allocated to the trend-cycle. The seasonal part
arises from the properties of the calendar that recur each year. For one
thing, the number of working days of months with 31 calendar days is on
average larger than that of months with 30 calendar days. This effect is
part of the seasonal pattern captured by the seasonal component (with
the exception of leap year effects). The structural part of the calendar
effect remains to be determined by the calendar adjustment. For example,
the number of working days of the same month in different years varies
from year to year.

Both X-12-ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO/SEATS estimate calendar
effects by adding some regressors to the equation estimated in the
pre-processing part (RegARIMA or TRAMO, respectively). Regressors
mentioned above are generated from the default calendar or the user
defined calendar.

The calendars of JDemetra+ simply correspond to the usual trading days
contrast variables based on the Gregorian calendar, modified to take
into account some specific holidays. Those holidays are handled as
\"Sundays\" and the variables are properly adjusted to take into account
the long term mean effects.



### Tests for residual trading days

We consider below tests on the seasonally adjusted series ($sa_t$) or on
the irregular component ($irr_t$). When the reasoning applies on both
components, we will use $y_t$. The functions $stdev$ stands for
"standard deviation" and $rms$ for "root mean squares"

The tests are computed on the log-transformed components in the case of
multiplicative decomposition.

TD are the usual contrasts of trading days, 6 variables (no specific
calendar).

#### Non significant irregular

When $irr_t$ is not significant, we don't compute the test on it, to
avoid irrelevant results. We consider that $irr_t$ is significant if
$stdev( irr_t)>0.01$ (multiplicative case) or if
$stdev(irr_t)/rms(sa_t) >0.01$ (additive case).

#### F test

The test is the usual joint F-test on the TD coefficients, computed on
the following models:

##### Autoregressive model (AR modelling option)

We compute by OLS:

$$y_t=\mu + \alpha y_{t-1} + \beta TD_t + \epsilon_t $$

##### Difference model

We compute by OLS:

$$\Delta y_t - \overline{\Delta y_t}=\beta TD_t + \epsilon_t $$

So, the latter model is a restriction of the first one
($\alpha =1, \mu =μ=\overline{\Delta y_t}$)

The tests are the usual joint F-tests on $\beta \quad (H_0:\beta=0)$.

By default, we compute the tests on the 8 last years of the components,
so that they might highlight moving calendar effects.

Remark:

In Tramo, a similar test is computed on the residuals of the Arima
model. More exactly, the F-test is computed on
$e_t=\beta TD_t + \epsilon_t$, where $e_t$ are the one-step-ahead
forecast errors.
