### M-stats

The details about the measures are given below.

-   $M1$ measures the contribution of the irregular component to the
    total variance. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier
    correction should be considered.

-   $M2$, which is a very similar to $M1$, is calculated on the
    basis of the contribution of the irregular component to the
    stationary portion of the variance. When it is above 1, some changes
    in an outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M3$ compares the irregular to the trend taken from a
    preliminary estimate of the seasonally adjusted series. If this
    ratio is too large, it is difficult to separate the two components
    from each other. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier
    correction should be considered.

-   $M4$ tests the randomness of the irregular component. A value
    above 1 denotes a correlation in the irregular component. In such
    case a shorter seasonal moving average filter should be considered.

-   $M5$ is used to compare the significance of changes in the trend
    with that in the irregular. When it is above 1 some changes in
    outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M6$ checks the $\text{SI}$ (seasonal – irregular components
    ratio). If annual changes in the irregular component are too small
    in relation to the annual changes in the seasonal component, the
    $3 \times 5$ seasonal filter used for the estimation of the
    seasonal component is not flexible enough to follow the seasonal
    movement. In such case a longer seasonal moving average filter
    should be considered. It should be stressed that $M6$ is
    calculated only if the $3 \times 5$ filter has been applied in
    the model.

-   $M7$ is the combined test for the presence of an identifiable
    seasonality. The test compares the relative contribution of stable
    and moving seasonality[^37].

-   $M8$ to $M11$ measure if the movements due to the short-term
    quasi-random variations and movements due to the long-term changes
    are not changing too much over the years. If the changes are too
    strong then the seasonal factors could be erroneous. In such case a
    correction for a seasonal break or the change of the seasonal filter
    should be considered.

The $Q$ statistic is a composite indicator calculated from the
$M$ statistics.

Edit : problem with tables display

|     |                                                                                               |          |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | $Q = \frac{10M1 + 11M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{100}$ | [1]<!---[5.25]--> |

$Q = Q - M2$ (also called $Q2$) is the $Q$ statistic for
which the $M2$ statistics was excluded from the formula, i.e.:

|     |                                                                                            |          |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | $Q - M2 = \frac{10M1 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{89}$ | [2]<!---[5.26]--> |

If a time series does not cover at least 6 years, the $M8$,
$M9$, $M10$ and $M11$ statistics cannot be calculated. In
this case the $Q$ statistic is computed as:

|     |                                                                     |          |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | $Q = \frac{14M1 + 15M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 32M7}{100}$ |  |

The model has a satisfactory quality if the $Q$ statistic is lower
than 1.

The tables displayed in the *Quality measures **→** Details* node
correspond to the F-set of tables produced by the original X-11
algorithm. To facilitate the analysis of the results, the numbers and
the names of the tables are given under each table following the
convention used in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).

### Detailed tables 

The first table presents the average percent change without regard to
sign of the percent changes (multiplicative model) or average
differences (additive model) over several periods (from 1 to 12 for a
monthly series, from 1 to 4 for a quarterly series) for the following
series:

-   $O$ – Original series (Table A1);



-   $\text{CI}$ – Final seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   $I$ – Final irregular component (Table D13);

-   $C$ – Final trend (Table D12);

-   $S$ – Final seasonal factors (Table D10);

-   $P$ – Preliminary adjustment coefficients, i.e. regressors
    estimated by the RegARIMA model (Table A2);

-   $TD\& H$ – Final calendar component (Tables A6 and A7);

-   $\text{Mod.O}$ – Original series adjusted for extreme values
    (Table E1);

-   $\text{Mod.CI}$ – Final seasonally adjusted series corrected for
    extreme values (Table E2);

-   $\text{Mod.I}$ – Final irregular component adjusted for extreme
    values (Table E3).

In the case of an additive decomposition, for each component the average
absolute changes over several periods are calculated as[^38]:

$$
\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}|Table_{t} - Table_{t - d}|
$$ [4]
 
where:

$d$ – time lag in periods (from a monthly time series $d$ varies
from to 4 or from 1 to 12);

$n$ – total number of observations per period;

$\text{Component}$ – the name of the component;

$\text{Table}$ – the name of the table that corresponds to the
component.

**Table F2A – changes, in the absolute values, of the principal components**

Next, Table F2B of relative contributions of the different components to
the differences (additive model) or percent changes (multiplicative
model) in the original series is displayed. They express the relative
importance of the changes in each component. Assuming that the
components are independent, the following relation is valid:

|                                                                                           |          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $O_{d}^{2} \approx C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$. | [5]<!---[5.29]--> |

In order to simplify the analysis, the approximation can be replaced by
the following equation:

|     |                                                                                      |          |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | $O_{d}^{*2} = C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$. | [6]<!---[5.30]--> |

The notation is the same as for Table F2A. The column $\text{Total}$
denotes total changes in the raw time series.

Data presented in Table F2B indicate the relative contribution of each
component to the percent changes (differences) in the original series
over each span, and are calculated as:

$\frac{I_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$,   

$\frac{C_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$,

$\frac{S_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, 

$\frac{P_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$

and $\frac{TD\& H_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$  

where:
$O_{d}^{*2} = I_{d}^{2} + C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2}{+ TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$.

The last column presents the *Ratio* calculated as:

$100 \times \frac{O_{d}^{*2}}{O_{d}^{2}}$, 

which is an indicator of how well the approximation

${(O_{d}^{*})}^{2} \approx O_{d}^{2}$
 
 
holds.

**Table F2B – relative contribution of components to changes in the raw series**

When an additive decomposition is used, Table F2C presents the average
and standard deviation of changes calculated for each time lag $d$,
taking into consideration the sign of the changes of the raw series and
its components. In case of a multiplicative decomposition the respective
table shows the average percent differences and related standard
deviations.


![Text](All_images/RDimage50.png)



**Table F2C – Averages and standard deviations of changes as a function of the time lag**

Average duration of run is an average number of consecutive monthly (or
quarterly) changes in the same direction (no change is counted as a
change in the same direction as the preceding change). JDemetra+
displays this indicator for the seasonally adjusted series, for the
trend and for the irregular component.


![Text](All_images/RDimage51.png)



**Table F2D – Average duration of run**

The $\frac{I}{C}\ $ratios for each value of time lag $d$,
presented in Table F2E, are computed on a basis of the data in Table F2A.


![Text](All_images/RDimage52.png)



**Table F2E – $\frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{C}}\mathbf{\ }$ratio for periods span**

The relative contribution of components to the variance of the
stationary part of the original series is calculated for the irregular
component ($I$), trend made stationary[^39] ($C$), seasonal
component ($S$) and calendar effects (TD&H). The short description
of the calculation method is given in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B.
(1999).


![Text](All_images/RDimage53.png)



**Table F2F – Relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series**

The last table shows the autocorrelogram of the irregular component from
Table D13. In the case of multiplicative decomposition it is calculated
for time lags between 1 and the number of periods per year +2 using the
formula[^40]:


$$
\text{Corr}_{k}I = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)(I_{t - k} - 1)}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)}^{2}}]
$$ [7]<!---[5.31]-->

where $N$ is number of observations in the time series and
$\text{k}$ the lag.


![Text](All_images/RDimage54.png)



**Table F2G – Autocorrelation of the irregular component**

The Cochran test is design to identify the heterogeneity of a series of
variances. X-13-ARIMA-SEATS uses this test in the extreme value
detection procedure to check if the irregular component is
heteroskedastic. In this procedure the standard errors of the irregular
component are used for an identification of extreme values. If the null
hypothesis that for all the periods (months, quarters) the variances of
the irregular component are identical is rejected, the standard errors
will be computed separately for each period (in case the option
*Calendarsigma*=**signif** has been selected).


![Text](All_images/RDimage55.png)



**Cochran test**

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month we will be looking at the mean annual
changes for each component by calculating:

$$
{\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}|S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1}|
$$

and

$$
{\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1}|
$$,


where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$ in the
data, and the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$:

$$
MSR_{i} = \frac{\overline{I}_{i}}{\overline{S}_{i}}
$$

These ratios are published in Table D9A in X13ARIMA-SEATS software. In
JDemetra+ they are presented in the details of the quality measures.

The [Moving Seasonality Ratio (MSR)](../theory/SA_X11.html#choosing-the-composite-moving-averages-when-estimating-the-seasonal-component) is used to measure the amount of
noise in the Seasonal-Irregular component. By studying these values, the
user can [select for each period the seasonal filter](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#seasonal-filter-x11-seasonalma) that is the most
suitable given the noisiness of the series.

    and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).

[^37]: See section [Combined seasonality tests](../theory/Tests_combined.html).

[^38]: For the multiplicative decomposition the following formula is
    used: 
$$
\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}{|\frac{\text{Tabl}e_{t}}{\text{Table}_{t - d}} - 1|}
$$.

[^39]: The component is estimated by extracting a linear trend from the
    trend component presented in Table D12.

[^40]: For the additive decomposition the formula is:
$$
Corr_{k}I_{t} = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} \times I_{t - k})}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t})}^{2}}
$$
