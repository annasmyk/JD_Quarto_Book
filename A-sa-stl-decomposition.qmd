## SA with STL {.unnumbered #a-sa-stl}

STL is a Loess (Weighted local regression) based decomposition algorithm used on linearized data, no integrated [pre-adjustment](#sa-pre-t).


## In this Chapter

We will cover how to use classic STL JDemetra+. M-STL functions for tackling multiple periodicities (with rounded frequencies) in infra-monthly data will be described in the [high-frequency]((#a-sa-hf)) data related chapter.  

More methodological details will be provided [here](#m-stl)

## Tools for access

In JDemetra+ STL is only available through [rjd3stl](https://github.com/rjdemetra/rjd3stl) package.
