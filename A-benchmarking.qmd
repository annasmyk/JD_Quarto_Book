# Benchmarking and temporal disagreggation {.unnumbered}

## Benchmarking overview

Often one has two (or multiple) series of different frequency for the same target variable. Sometimes, however, these series are not coherent in the sense that they don't match up. Benchmarking\[\^1\] is a method to deal with this situation. An aggregate of a higher-frequency measurement variables is not necessarily equal to the corresponding lower-frequency less-aggregated measurement. Moreover, the sources of data may have different reliability levels. Usually, less frequent data are considered more trustworthy as they are based on larger samples and compiled more precisely. The more reliable measurements, hence often the less frequent, will serve as benchmark.

In seasonal adjustment methods benchmarking is the procedure that ensures the consistency over the year between adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted data. It should be noted that the \[ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015)\] (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3), do not recommend benchmarking as it introduces a bias in the seasonally adjusted data. The U.S. Census Bureau also points out that "*forcing the seasonal adjustment totals to be the same as the original series annual totals can degrade the quality of the seasonal adjustment, especially when the seasonal pattern is undergoing change. It is not natural if trading day adjustment is performed because the aggregate trading day effect over a year is variable and moderately different from zero*"\[\^2\]. Nevertheless, some users may need that the annual totals of the seasonally adjusted series match the annual totals of the original, non-seasonally adjusted series\[\^3\].

According to the \[ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015)\] (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3), the only benefit of this approach is that there is consistency over the year between adjusted and the non-seasonally adjusted data; this can be of particular interest when low-frequency (e.g. annual) benchmarking figures officially exist (e.g. National Accounts, Balance of Payments, External Trade, etc.) and where users' needs for time consistency are stronger.



## Tools

### Benchmarking with GUI 
1.  With the [pre-defined specifcations](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html) the benchmarking functionality is not
    applied by default following the *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015)
    recommendations. It means that once the user has seasonally adjustd the series with a pre-defined specifcation the *Benchmarking* node is empty.
	To execute benchmarking click on
    the *Specifications* button and activate the checkbox in the
    *Benchmarking* section.
	
	
	![Text](All_images/UDimage1.jpg)

	

	**Benchmarking option – a default view**

1.  Three parameters can be set here. *Target* specifies the target
    variable for the benchmarking procedure. It can be either the *Original* (the
    raw time series) or the *Calendar
    Adjusted* (the time series adjusted for calendar effects). *Rho* is a value of the AR(1) parameter
    (set between 0 and 1). By default it is set to 1. Finally, *Lambda*
    is a parameter that relates to the weights in the regression
    equation. It is typically equal to 0 (for an additive
    decomposition), 0.5 (for a proportional decomposition) or 1 (for a
    multiplicative decomposition). The default value is 1.

2.  To launch the benchmarking procedure click on the **Apply** button. The
    results are displayed in four panels. The top-left one compares the
    original output from the seasonal adjustment procedure with the result
    from applying a benchmarking to the seasonal adjustment. The
    bottom-left panel highlights the differences between these two
    results. The outcomes are also presented in a table in the top-right
    panel. The relevant statistics concerning relative differences are
    presented in the bottom-right panel.

	**The results of the benchmarking procedure**

1.  Both pictures and the table can be copied the usual way 
    (see the [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario).

	
	![Text](All_images/UDimage3.jpg)

	

	**Options for benchmarking results**

1.  To export the result of the benchmarking procedure (*benchmarking.result*) and
    the target data (*benchmarking.target*) one needs to once execute the seasonal adjustment with benchmarking using the
	muli-processing option (see the [*Simple seasonal adjustment of multiple time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html) scenario.
	Once the muli-processing is executed, select the *Output* item from the *SAProcessing* menu.

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image28.jpg)

	

	**The *SAProcessing* menu**
	
1. Expand the \"+\" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content of
    the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

	
	![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

	

	**Exporting data to an Excel file**

1. Chose the output items that refer to the results from the benchmarking procedure, move them to the window on the right and  click **OK**.

### Benchmarking in R

See package **rjd3bench** and its documentation pages in R.


### Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation plugin

Select Tools $\rightarrow$ Plug-ins for JDemetra+ to install Benchmarking plugin.

Once the plugin is installed, two more options appear in the Workspace window: Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation.

## Benchmarking

These methods provide a high-frequency series (input series) modified so that it fulfills a linear relationship, with another series of low frequency (benchmark), both series measure the same target variable. An example of the relation to be fulfilled could be that the
low frequency series (quarterly frequency) coincides with the quarterly sum of the high frequency series (monthly frequency).

Multivariate benchmarking also imposes contemporary linear relations,
between high frequency series. If these relations do not exist, benchmarking could be carried out of each series separately. Normally contemporary relations are linear and the relations of aggregation is also linear and the same for all series, so low frequency series
contemporary relations also meet.

The benchmarking methods available in the benchmarking and time disaggregation plug-in are: Denton, Cholette, and Cholette multivariate.

### Benchmarking univariate: Denton and Cholette

To run Denton univariate case select:

Statistical Methods $\rightarrow$ Benchmarking $\rightarrow$ Denton or Cholette


![Text](All_images/Image2_Bench.png)


In both cases, a new window is displayed to launch one of the methods with the series selected. In the upper left side, drag the high frequency series from the Providers window and drop it in **Drop Series here** and the low frequency series in **Drop Constraint here**.

#### Denton

In the top right of the screen, select the **Specifications** button to set the specifications to apply each method. See below for a description of the available options on Denton method:

1. **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This forces the
low-frequency series to match the aggregation function selected of the high frequency series.

2. **Multiplicative**: if the checkbox is selected, the proportional Denton method is applied. Otherwise, additive Denton is applied.

3. **Modified Denton**: if the checkbox is selected, the modified Denton method is applied. Otherwise, original Denton is applied. It is recommended to select it; as original Denton does a special treatment on the first observation.

4. **Differencing**: Number of regular differences. By default 1.

5. **Default frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data. The options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly, Bimonthly and Monthly.



![Denton Specifications](All_images/Image3_Bench.png)

#### Cholette

See below for a description of the available options on Cholette method:

1. **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This forces the
low-frequency series to match the aggregation function selected of the high frequency series.
2. **Aggregation frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data. The options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly, Bimonthly and Monthly.
3. **Rho**: value between $-1$ and $1$. It is the coefficient of an AR($1$) model that follows the error term. The default value is $1$, equivalent to applying Denton.

4. **Lambda**: value between $0$ and $1$. It is the parameter $\lambda$ of the following function to be minimized in Cholette method:
    $$
    \sum_t \left( \frac{x_t - z_t}{\left| z_t \right|^{\lambda}} - \rho \frac{x_{t-1} - z_{t-1}}{\left| z_{t-1} \right|^{\lambda}}\right)^2
    $$
    Usually lambda is $0$ or $1$ equivalent to apply additive benchmarking and proportional benchmarking method respectively.

![Cholette Specifications](All_images/Image4_Bench.png)

In both cases, Denton and Cholette methods, the output is a graph with the original series and the benchmarked series. There is no table with the results, but it is very easy to create one from the graph. Select the graph and select copy, then paste the values in excel (control-V).

### Multi-variate Benchmarking : Cholette

## Temporal Disaggregation 

These methods are used to disaggregate a series from low frequency to high-frequency. Temporal disaggregaton methods.
The methods developed in the plug-in are Chow-Lin, Fernández and Litterman.
These methods define a high-frequency model that linearly relates a high frequency series (unobserved, input series) with p auxiliar series (indicators).
See Methods$\rightarrow$Temporal disaggregation for more theoretical detail.

### Temporal Disaggregation in the GUI
To run Temporal Disaggregation methods click on:

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image6_TD.png)

A new window is displayed to launch one of the methods with the series selected. In the upper left side, it is necessary to drag the low frequency series from the Providers window and drop it in **Y box** and the proxy series or indicator frequency series in **X box**.
In the top right of the screen, select the **Specifications** button to set the specifications to apply each method. Let see a description of the available options on Temporal Disaggregation methods:

1. **Estimation span**: Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series to be used in the temporal disaggregation process. The user can restrict the span.
