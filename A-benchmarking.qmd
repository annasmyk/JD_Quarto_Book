## Benchmarking seasonally adjusted data {#a-bench-sa}

The goal here is to enforce identical annual totals on the seasonally
adjusted series as on the raw or calendar adjusted series.

### Using the GUI

When running a seasonal adjustment process

1.  With the pre-defined specifications the benchmarking functionality
    is not applied by default following the *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal
    Adjustment* (2015) recommendations. It means that once the user has
    seasonally adjusted the series with a pre-defined specification the
    *Benchmarking* node is empty. To execute benchmarking click on the
    *Specifications* button and activate the checkbox in the
    *Benchmarking* section.

    ![**Benchmarking option -- a default
    view**](All_images/UDimage1.jpg)

2.  Three parameters can be set here. *Target* specifies the target
    variable for the benchmarking procedure. It can be either the
    *Original* (the raw time series) or the *Calendar Adjusted* (the
    time series adjusted for calendar effects). *Rho* is a value of the
    AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). By default it is set to 1.
    Finally, *Lambda* is a parameter that relates to the weights in the
    regression equation. It is typically equal to 0 (for an additive
    decomposition), 0.5 (for a proportional decomposition) or 1 (for a
    multiplicative decomposition). The default value is 1.

3.  To launch the benchmarking procedure click on the **Apply** button.
    The results are displayed in four panels. The top-left one compares
    the original output from the seasonal adjustment procedure with the
    result from applying a benchmarking to the seasonal adjustment. The
    bottom-left panel highlights the differences between these two
    results. The outcomes are also presented in a table in the top-right
    panel. The relevant statistics concerning relative differences are
    presented in the bottom-right panel.

    ![**The results of the benchmarking
    procedure**](All_images/UDimage2.jpg)

4.  Both pictures and the table can be copied the usual way (see the
    [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario).

    ![**Options for benchmarking results**](All_images/UDimage3.jpg)

5.  To export the result of the benchmarking procedure
    (*benchmarking.result*) and the target data (*benchmarking.target*)
    one needs to once execute the seasonal adjustment with benchmarking

    ![**The *SAProcessing* menu**](All_images/UG_SSA_image28.jpg)

6.  Expand the "+" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content
    of the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

    ![**Exporting data to an Excel
    file**](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

7.  Chose the output items that refer to the results from the
    benchmarking procedure, move them to the window on the right and
    click **OK**.

    ![**Exporting the results of the benchmarking
    procedure**](All_images/UDimage4.jpg)

### In R with `rjd3x13` and `rjd3tramoseats`

When performing seasonal adjustment with `rjd3x13` and `rjd3tramoseats`,
the current (or default) specification has to be customized using the
function `rjd3toolkit::set_benchmarking` documented on this [GitHub
page](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3toolkit/reference/set_benchmarking.html)

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
init_spec <- rjd3x13::spec_x13("RSA5c")
new_spec <- set_benchmarking(init_spec,
                           enabled = TRUE,
                           target = "Normal",
                           rho = 0.8,
                           lambda = 0.5,
                           forecast = FALSE,
                           bias = "None")


```

## Benchmarking with different frequencies {#a-bench-high-low}

These methods provide a high-frequency series (input series) modified so
that it fulfils a linear relationship, with another series of low
frequency (benchmark), both series measure the same target variable. An
example of the relation to be fulfilled could be that the low frequency
series (quarterly frequency) coincides with the quarterly sum of the
high frequency series (monthly frequency).

Multivariate benchmarking also forces contemporary linear relations
between high frequency series. If these relations do not exist,
benchmarking could be carried out for each series separately. Normally
contemporary relations are linear and the relations of aggregation are
also linear and the same for all series, so the contemporary relations
between low frequency series are fulfilled.

The benchmarking methods available in the benchmarking and time
disaggregation plug-in are: Denton, Cholette, and Cholette multivariate.

### Using the plug-in for GUI (version 2.x) {#a-bench-td-plugin}

Download the plug-in for GUI as explained [here](#t-plug-ins-bench) and
install it as detailed [here](#t-plug-ins-inst)

Once the plugin is installed, two more options appear in the Workspace
window: Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation.

![Text](All_images/Image1_Bench.jpg)

#### Univariate: Denton and Cholette

To run Denton univariate case select:

Statistical **Methods** $\rightarrow$ Benchmarking $\rightarrow$ Denton
or Cholette

![**Benchmarking tab**](All_images/Image2_Bench.png)

In both cases, a new window is displayed to launch one of the methods
with the series selected. In the upper left side, drag the high
frequency series from the Providers window and drop it in **Drop Series
here** and the low frequency series in **Drop Constraint here**.

#### Denton

In the top right of the screen, select the **Specifications** button to
set the specifications to apply each method. See below for a description
of the available options on Denton method:

1.  **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This
    forces the low-frequency series to match the aggregation function
    selected of the high frequency series.

2.  **Multiplicative**: if the checkbox is selected, the proportional
    Denton method is applied. Otherwise, additive Denton is applied.

3.  **Modified Denton**: if the checkbox is selected, the modified
    Denton method is applied. Otherwise, original Denton is applied. It
    is recommended to select it; as original Denton perform a special
    treatment on the first observation.

4.  **Differencing**: Number of regular differences. By default 1.

5.  **Default frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data. The
    options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly, Bimonthly
    and Monthly.

![Denton Specifications](All_images/Image3_Bench.png)

#### Cholette {#a-bench-high-low-cholette}

See below for a description of the available options on Cholette method:

1.  **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This
    forces the low-frequency series to match the aggregation function
    selected of the high frequency series.

2.  **Aggregation frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data.
    The options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly,
    Bimonthly and Monthly.

3.  **Rho**: value between $-1$ and $1$. It is the coefficient of an
    AR($1$) model that follows the error term. The default value is $1$,
    equivalent to applying Denton.

4.  **Lambda**: value between $0$ and $1$. It is the parameter $\lambda$
    of the following function to be minimized in Cholette method:

    $$
     \sum_t \left( \frac{x_t - z_t}{\left| z_t \right|^{\lambda}} - \rho \frac{x_{t-1} - z_{t-1}}{\left| z_{t-1} \right|^{\lambda}}\right)^2
     $$

    Usually lambda is $0$ or $1$ equivalent to applying additive
    benchmarking and proportional benchmarking method respectively.

![Cholette Specifications](All_images/Image4_Bench.png)

In both cases, Denton and Cholette methods, the output is a graph with
the original series and the benchmarked series. There is no table with
the results, but it is very easy to create one from the graph. Select
the graph and select copy, then paste the values in excel (control-V).

![Denton output](All_images/Image5_Bench.png)

#### Multi-variate Cholette

The only multi-variate benchmarking method available for the version 2 plugin, is
multi-variate Cholette.

The input for this method are a set of time series with different
frequencies and a set of constraints, both contemporary and
intertemporal. The output is a new set of time series, that corresponds
to the former, now fulfilling the constraints.

To run multi-variate Cholette select *Statistical methods*
$\rightarrow$ *Benchmarking* $\rightarrow$ *Multi-variate Cholette*.
Then, a box appears, where we can drop time series.

![Multi-variate Cholette input](All_images/CholetteMulti.png)

The specification properties can be set by selecting  *Window* $\rightarrow$ 
*Properties*. There are only three elements in the form: *Rho*, *Lambda* and
*Constraints*. The two first are analogous to their [univariate Cholette](#a-bench-high-low-cholette)
counterparts. The third one allows to set constraints, both contemporary and
intertemporal.

![Multi-variate Cholette specification](All_images/PropCholetteMulti.png)

Clicking the three dots button from *Constraints*, opens the constraints list
box.

![Constraints list](All_images/Constraints.png)

From this box, the set of constraints can be added, just typing the constraint
inside item and clicking *Add* button. The constraints must be written as
follows:

- $y = a_1 * x_1 + \dots + a_n * x_n$ where $y, x_1, \dots, x_n$ are same
frequency time series and $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are constant.
- $c = a_1 * x_1 + \dots + a_n * x_n$ where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are same frequency
time series and $c, a_1, \dots, a_n$ are constant.
- $c = x_1 + \dots + x_n$ can be shortened as $c = x?$.
- $S = \mathrm{sum}(s)$ where $S$ is low-frequency and $s$ is high-frequency.

Note that any time series put on the left hand side can't appear on the right
hand side of any other constraint. This is because left hand side quantities
are fixed while right hand side quantities are adjusted so the equality holds.

The output are the benchmarked high-frequency time series, that can be found
in *Details* $\rightarrow$ *Benchmarked series*.

### Using the plug-in for GUI (version 3.x)

Practical use of the plug-in for v 3.x is quasi identical to the one in v2.x described
[above](#a-bench-td-plugin). Some methods are not available yet in v 3.x but the latter which contains Model

Based Denton not included in v2.x, as stated [here](#a-b-td-overview)

## Temporal Disaggregation {#a-bench-tempd}

These methods are used to disaggregate a series from low frequency to
high frequency. Temporal disaggregation methods developed in the plug-in
are Chow-Lin, Fernández and Litterman.

When there are high frequency related indicators, these methods provide
high frequency estimations for a series whose sums, averages, first or
last values are consistent with the observed low frequency series,
applying a regression model where it is assumed that the high frequency
series to be estimated follows a multiple regression with p related
series (indicators).

See Methods$\rightarrow$Temporal disaggregation for more theoretical
detail.

### Using the plug-in for GUI

Temporal disaggregation in the GUI is available with the same
[plug-in](#a-bench-td-plugin) as benchmarking (described in the sections
above)

To run Temporal Disaggregation methods select Temporal
disaggregation$\rightarrow$ Regression Model:

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image6_TD.png)

A new window is displayed to launch one of the methods with the series
selected. In the upper left side drag the low frequency series from the
Providers window and drop it in **Y box** and the proxy series or
indicator with high frequency series in **X box**.

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image7_TD.png)

In the top right of the screen, select **Specifications** to set the
specifications to apply each method. Here is a description of the
available options on Temporal Disaggregation methods:

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image8_TD.png)

1.  **Estimation span**: Specifies the span (data interval) of the time
    series to be used in the temporal disaggregation process. The user
    can restrict the span. The common settings are:

| Option            | Description (expected format)                                                                                                                                               |     |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| All               | default                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| From              | first observation included (yyyy-mm-dd)                                                                                                                                     |     |
| To                | last observation included (yyyy-mm-dd)                                                                                                                                      |     |
| Between           | interval \[from ; to\] included (yyyy-mm-dd to yyyy-mm-dd)                                                                                                                  |     |
| First             | number of observtions from the beginning of the series included (dynamic) (integer)                                                                                         |     |
| Last              | number of observations from the end of the series (dynamic)(integer)                                                                                                        |     |
| Excluding         | excluding N first observation and P last observation from the computation,dynamic) (integer)                                                                                |     |
| Preliminary check | check to exclude highly problematic series e.g. the series with a number of identical observations and/or missing values above pre-specified threshold values. (True/False) |     |

2.  **Error**: determines the method to be applied and it refers to the
    model that follows the error term.

| Option | Description                |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Ar1    | Chow-Lin method (default)  |
| Wn     | Classical Regression model |
| Rw     | Fernández                  |
| RwAr1  | Litterman                  |
| I2     | Integrated order 2         |
| I3     | Integrated order 3         |

3.  **Parameter**: Coefficient of the AR(1) of the innovations model. It
    has a value between -1 and 1. This parameter exists only if RWar1 or
    Ar1 is selected in the error parameter.

4.  **Constant**: a constant is included in the model if it is selected.

5.  **Trend**: a linear trend is included in the model if it is
    selected.

6.  **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This
    forces the low-frequency series to match the aggregation function
    selected of the high frequency series.

7.  **Default frequency**: it is the frequency of the output series.

8.  **Advanced options**: These parameters are related to state space
    model and the algorithm used to obtain the estimations.

    8.1. **Diffuse regression coefficient**: Indicates if the
    coefficients of the regression model are diffuse (T) or fixed
    unknown (F, default).

Here are the results:

![Temporal Disaggregation](All_images/Image9_TD.png)

Select **Model**$\rightarrow$Summary to see the estimation of $rho$
(coefficient of the AR(1) model) and the coefficient of the regression
model. Additionally the BIC, AIC and AICC. It is also showed the
variance decomposition in Indicators and Smoothing. Ideally, if the
indicator adequately approximates the aggregate in the observable domain
(low frequency model), the residuals of the low frequency model will be
small and the indicator term will dominate. \\

To confirm that the model works well, select
**Model**$\rightarrow$Residuals$\rightarrow$Statistics and see the tests
on the residuals of the model:

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image10_TD.png)

Select MainResults$\rightarrow$Table to obtain the disaggregated series
and standard deviation.

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image11_TD.png)

Select **MainResults**$\rightarrow$Chart to see a graph of the
disaggregated series and the confidence interval.

### In R with `rjd3bench`

Use the \[rjd3bench\](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3bench) package and
see its documentation pages. Browse its documentation on this [GitHub
page](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3bench/).

To get started browse the
[vignette](https://rjdverse.github.io/rjd3bench/articles/rjd3bench.html)

More information on R packages for JDemetra+ and installation procedures
is provided in [this chapter](#t-r-packs)

#### Temporal Disaggregation

To perform Temporal Disaggregation methods use the function
**temporaldisaggregation**:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
output <- rjd3bench::temporaldisaggregation(
    series = y, indicators = x, model = "Rw", freq = 12,
    conversion = "Average", diffuse.algorithm = "Diffuse"
)
```

The input parameters are the same as in the GUI, see the R Documentation
of the rjd3bench package for the description.

The output is a list containing 3 elements:

1.  **Regression**: contains information about:

    -   Type of method applied:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$regression$type

    ```

    -   The model (coefficient estimation, standard deviation and
        T-statistic):

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$regression$model

    ```

    -   Conversion:Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First):

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$regression$conversion

    ```

2.  **Estimation**: contains information about:

    -   The disaggregated series:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$disagg

    ```

    -   The standard deviation of the disaggregated series:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$edisagg

    ```

    -   The regressor effect:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$regeffect

    ```

    -   The smoothing part:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$smoothingpart

    ```

    -   The $rho$ estimation (coefficient of the AR(1) model): This
        parameter exists only if RWar1 or Ar1 is selected in the model.

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$parameter

    ```

    -   The standard deviation of the AR(1) coefficient:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

    output$estimation$eparameter

    ```

3.  **Likelihood**: Contains information about the loglikelihood(ll),
    sum of squares of the residuals of the model (ssq), number of
    observations (nobs), number of parameters to be estimated (nparams),
    degrees of freedom (df), Akaike Information Criteria (aic), Akaike
    Information Criteria Corrected (aicc), Bayesian Information Criteria
    (bic), Bayesian Information Criteria Corrected (bic2).
