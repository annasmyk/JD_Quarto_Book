## Spectral analysis concepts and overview

A time series $x_{t}$ with stationary covariance, mean $μ$ and $k^{th}$ autocovariance $E(x_{t}-\mu)(x_{t- k}\mu))=\gamma(k)$ can be described as a weighted sum of periodic trigonometric functions: $sin(\omega t)$ and $cos(\omega t)$, where $\omega=\frac{2*pi}{T}$ denotes frequency. Spectral analysis investigates this frequency domain representation of $x_{t}$ to determine how important cycles of different frequencies are in accounting for the behavior of $x_{t}$.

Assuming that the autocovariances $\gamma(k)$ are absolutely summable($\sum_{k =-\infty}^{\infty}|\gamma(k)|<\infty$), the autocovariance generating function, which summarizes these autocovariances through a scalar valued function, is given by equation \[1\][^m-spectral-analysis-1].

[^m-spectral-analysis-1]: HAMILTON, J.D. (1994).

$acgf(z)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{z^{k}\gamma(k)}$,

where $z$ denotes complex scalar.

Once the equation \[1\]is divided by $\pi$ and evaluated at some $z{= e}^{- i\omega} = cos\omega - isin\omega$, where $i = \sqrt{- 1}$ and $\omega$ is a real scalar,$\  - \infty < \ \omega < \infty$, the result of this transformation is called a population spectrum \$f(\omega)\$for $\ x_{t}$, given in equation \[2\][^m-spectral-analysis-2].

[^m-spectral-analysis-2]: HAMILTON, J.D. (1994).

$$f(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{k = - \infty}^{\infty}{e^{- ik\omega}\gamma(k)}$$

Therefore, the analysis of the population spectrum in the frequency domain is equivalent to the examination of the autocovariance function in the time domain analysis; however it provides an alternative way of inspecting the process. Because $f(\omega)\text{dω}$ is interpreted as a contribution to the variance of components with frequencies in the range $(\omega,\ \omega + d\omega)$, a peak in the spectrum indicates an important contribution to the variance at frequencies near the value that corresponds to this peak.

As \$e\^{- i\omega} = cos\omega - isin\omega,\$the spectrum can be also expressed as in equation \[3\].

$$f(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{k = - \infty}^{\infty}{(cos\omega k - isin\omega k)\gamma(k)}$$

Since $\gamma(k) = \gamma( - k)$ (i.e. \$\gamma(k)\$is an even function of $k$) and $\sin{( - x)}\  = \operatorname{-sin}x$, \[3\]<!---\[7.100\]--> can be presented as equation

$$f(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi}\lbrack \ \gamma(0) + 2\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}{\ \gamma(k)}cos\text{ωk} \rbrack$$,

This implies that if autocovariances are absolutely summable the population spectrum exists and is a continuous, real-valued function of $\omega$. Due to the properties of trigonometric functions \$(\cos( - \omega k) = \cos(\text{ωk}) . \$and \$.  \cos(\omega + 2\pi j)k = cos(\omega k))\$the spectrum is a periodic, even function of $\omega$, symmetric around $\omega = 0$. Therefore, the analysis of the spectrum can be reduced to the interval $( - \pi,\pi).$ The spectrum is non-negative for all $\omega \in ( - \pi,\pi)$.

The shortest cycle that can be distinguished in a time series lasts two periods. The frequency which corresponds to this cycle is $\omega = \pi$ and is called the Nyquist frequency. The frequency of the longest cycles that can be observed in the time series with $n$ observations is $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{n}$ and is called the fundamental (Fourier) frequency.

Note that if $x_{t}$ is a white noise process with zero mean and variance $\sigma^{2}$, then for all $|k|> 0$ $\gamma(k)=0$ and the spectrum of $x_{t}$ is constant ($f(\omega)= \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\pi}$) since each frequency in the spectrum contributes equally to the variance of the process[^m-spectral-analysis-3].

[^m-spectral-analysis-3]: BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2002).

The aim of spectral analysis is to determine how important cycles of different frequencies are in accounting for the behaviour of a time series[^m-spectral-analysis-4]. Since spectral analysis can be used to detect the presence of periodic components, it is a natural diagnostic tool for detecting trading day effects as well as seasonal effects[^m-spectral-analysis-5]. Among the tools used for spectral analysis are the autoregressive spectrum and the periodogram.

### Theoretical spectral density of an ARIMA model

## Spectral density estimation

### Method 1: The periodogram

For any given frequency $\omega$ the sample periodogram is the sample analog of the sample spectrum. In general, the periodogram is used to identify the periodic components of unknown frequency in the time series. X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS use this tool for detecting seasonality in raw time series and seasonally adjusted series. Apart from this it is applied for checking randomness of the residuals from the ARIMA model.

To define the periodogram, first consider the vector of complex numbers[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-1]:

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-1]: BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2002).

$$\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}      
  x_{1} \\                             
  x_{2} \\                             
  . \\                                 
  . \\                                 
  . \\                                 
  x_{n} \\                             
  \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$$

where $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is the set of all column vectors with complex-valued components.

The Fourier frequencies associated with the sample size $n$ are defined as a set of values $ω_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}$, $j = - \lbrack \frac{n-1}{2}\rbrack,\ldots,\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack$, $-\pi< \omega_{j} \leq \pi$, $j\in F_{n}$, where ${\lbrack n\rbrack}$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $n$. The Fourier frequencies, which are called harmonics, are given by integer multiples of the fundamental frequency $\ \frac{2\pi}{n}$.

Now the $n$ vectors $$e_{j} = n^{- \frac{1}{2}}(e^{-i\omega_{j}},e^{-i{2\omega}_{j}},
\ldots,e^{- inω_{j}})^{'}$$ can be defined. Vectors $$e_{1},\ldots, e_{n}$$ are orthonormal in the sense that:

$$
 {\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\mathbf{e}}_{k} = n^{- 1}\sum_{r = 1}^{n}e^{ir(\omega_{j} - \omega_{k})} = { \begin{matrix}  
  1,\ if\ j = k \\                                                                                                         
  0,\ if\ j \neq k \\                                                                                                      
  \end{matrix} .\ 
$$

where $$\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}$$ denotes the row vector, which $$k^{th}$$ component is the complex conjugate of the $$k^{th}$$ component of $$\mathbf{e}_{j}$$.[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-2] These vectors are a basis of $$F_{n}$$, so that any $$\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}$$ can be expressed as a sum of $$n$$ components:

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-2]: For details see BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2006).

$$
 \mathbf{x} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}{a_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}}
$$

where the coefficients $$a_{j} = \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\mathbf{x}=n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}e^{-it\omega_{j}}$$ are derived from \[3\] by multiplying the equation on the left by $$\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}$$ and using \[1\].

The sequence of $\{a_{j},j\in F_{n}\}$ is referred as a discrete Fourier transform of $\mathbf{x}\mathbb{\in C}^{n}$ and the periodogram $I(\omega_{j})$ of $\mathbf{x}$ at Fourier frequency $\omega_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}$ is defined as the square of the Fourier transform $$\{a_{j}\}$$ of $\mathbf{x}$:

$$
{I(\omega_{j})\mathbf{=}{| a_{j} |^{2}}_{\ } = n^{- \ 1}| \sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}e^{- it\omega_{j}} |^{2}}_{\mathbf{\ }}
$$

From \[2\] and \[3\] it can be shown that in fact the periodogram decomposes the total sum of squares $\sum_{t = 1}^{n}| x_{t} |^{2}$ into a sums of components associated with the Fourier frequencies $$ω_{j}$$:

$$
  \sum_{t=1}^{n}{|x_{t}|}^{2} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}|a_{j}|^{2} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}{I(\omega_{j})}
$$

If $\ \mathbf{x\  \in}\ {R}^{n}$, $\omega_{j}$ and $${-\omega}_{j}$$ are both in $$\lbrack- \pi, -\pi \rbrack$$ and $$a_{j}$$ is presented in its polar form (i.e.$$a_{j} = r_{j}\exp( i\theta_{j})$$), where $r_{j}$ is the modulus of $$a_{j}$$, then \[3\] can be rewritten in the form:

$$
 \mathbf{x} = a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} + \sum_{j = 1}^{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}{ {2^{1/2}r}_{j}{(\mathbf{c}}_{j}\cos\theta_{j}{- \mathbf{s}}_{j}\sin\theta_{j}) + a_{n/2}\mathbf{e}_{n/2}}
 $$

The orthonormal basis for $${R}^{n}$$ is $$\{\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{c}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{c}_{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack},\mathbf{s}_{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack},\mathbf{e}_{\frac{n}{2}(excluded\ if\ n\ is\ odd)}\}
$$, where:

$$\mathbf{e}_{0}$$ is a vector composed of n elements equal to $$n^{- 1/2}$$, which implies that $$\mathbf{a}_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} = {(n^{-1}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t},\ldots,n^{- 1}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t})}^{'}$$;

$$
\mathbf{c}_{j}=(\frac{n}{2})^{- 1/2}{(\cos\omega_{j},\cos{2\omega}_{j},\ldots,\cos{n\omega_{j}})}^{'}, for 1 \leq j \leq \lbrack \frac{(n - 1)}{2}\rbrack
$$ ;

$$
\mathbf{s}_{j} = {(\frac{n}{2})}^{-1/2}{(\sin{\omega_{j}},\sin{2\omega_{j}},\ldots,\sin{n\omega_{j}})}^{'},\ for\ 1 \leq j \leq \lbrack \frac{(n - 1)}{2} \rbrack
$$;

$$
\mathbf{e}_{n/2} = {(- (n^{-\frac{1}{2}}),n^{- \frac{1}{2}},\ldots,{-(n)}^{- \frac{1}{2}}),n^{-\frac{1}{2}})}^{'}
$$.

Equation \[5\] can be seen as an OLS regression of $$x_{t}$$ on a constant and the trigonometric terms. As the vector of explanatory variables includes $$n$$ elements, the number of explanatory variables in \[5\] is equal to the number of observations. HAMILTON, J.D. (1994) shows that the explanatory variables are linearly independent, which implies that an OLS regression yields a perfect fit (i.e. without an error term). The coefficients have the form of a simple OLS projection of the data on the orthonormal basis:

$$
  {\widehat{a}}_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t}
  $$ \[7\] <!---\[7.108\]      -->

$$
  {\widehat{a}}_{n/2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}{(-1)}^{t}x_{t}(   \text{only when n is even})
  $$ \[8\] <!---\[7.109\]      -->

$$
  {\widehat{a}}_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t}
  $$ \[9\] <!---\[7.110\]      -->

$$
  {\widehat{\alpha}}_{j} = 2^{1/2}r_{j}\cos{\theta_{j}} = {(\frac{n}{2})}^{- 1/2}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}\cos{(t\frac{2\pi j}{n})}, j   = 1,\ldots,\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack
  $$ \[10\] <!---\[7.111\]      -->

$$
  {\widehat{\beta}}_{j} = 2^{1/2}r_{j}\sin{\theta_{j}} = {(\frac{n}{2})}^{-1/2}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}\sin{(t\frac{2\pi j}{n})}, j = 1,\ldots,\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack
  $$ \[11\] <!---\[7.112\]      -->

With \[5\] the total sum of squares $\sum_{t = 1}^{n}| x_{t} |^{2}$ can be decomposed into $$2 \times \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack$$ components corresponding to $$\mathbf{c}_{j}$$ and $$\mathbf{s}_{j}$$, which are grouped to produce the "frequency $$ω_{j}$$" component for $$1 \geq j \geq \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack$$. As it is shown in the table below, the value of the periodogram at the frequency $\omega_{j}$ is the contribution of the\$ j\^{\text{th}}\$harmonic to the total sum of squares $\sum_{t = 1}^{n}| x_{t} |^{2}$.

Obviously, if series were random then each component \$I(\omega\_{j})\$would have the same expectation. On the contrary, when the series contains a systematic sine component having a frequency $j$ and amplitude $A$ then the sum of squares $I(\omega_{j})$ increases with $A$. In practice, it is unlikely that the frequency $j$ of an unknown systematic sine component would exacly match any of the frequencies, for which peridogram have been calcuated. Therefore, the periodogram would show an increase in intensities in the immediate vicinity of $j$.[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-3]

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-3]: BOX, G.E.P., JENKINS, G.M., and REINSEL, G.C. (2007).

Note that in JDemetra+ the periodogram object corresponds exactly to the contribution to the sum of squares of the standardised data, since the series are divided by their standard deviation for computational reasons.

Using the decomposition presented in table above the periodogram can be expressed as:

$$
I(\omega_{j})\mathbf{=}\begin{matrix}                                                                                r_{j}^{2} = \frac{1}{2}{(\alpha}_{j}^{2} + \beta_{j}^{2}) = \ {\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{t = 1}^{n}{x_{t}\cos{( {t\frac{2\pi j}{n}}_{\ })\ }})}^{2} + \frac{1}{n}(\sum_{t = 1}^{n}{x_{t}\sin( t\frac{2\pi j}{n})_{\ }})^{2} \\   
\end{matrix}
$$ \[12\] <!---\[7.113\]      -->

where $j = 0,\ldots,lbrack \frac{n}{2} rbrack$*.*

Since $\mathbf{x} - \overline{\mathbf{x}}$ are generated by an orthonormal basis, and $\overline{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{=}a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0}$ \[5\] can be rearranged to show that the sum of squares is equal to the sum of the squared coefficients:

$$
 \mathbf{x} - a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} =\sum_{j=1}^{\lbrack(n - 1)/2\rbrack}(\alpha_{j}\mathbf{c}_{j}+\beta_{j}\mathbf{s}_{j}) + a_{n/2}\mathbf{e}_{n/2}
 $$. \[13\] <!---\[7.114\]      -->

Thus the sample variance of $$x_{t}$$ can be expressed as:

$$
n^{- 1}\sum_{t=1}^{n}{(x_{t}-\overline{x})}^{2}=n^{-1}(\sum_{k=1}^{\lbrack(n - 1)/2\rbrack}2{r_{j}}^{2}
+{a_{n/2}}^{2}) 
$$, \[14\] <!---\[7.115\]      -->

where $a_{n/2}^{2}$ is excluded if $n$ is odd.

The term $$2{r_{j}}^{2}$$ in \[14\] is then the contribution of the $j^{\text{th}}$ harmonic to the variance and \[14\] shows then how the total variance is partitioned.

The periodogram ordinate $I(\omega_{j})$ and the autocovariance coefficient $\gamma(k)$ are both quadratic forms of $$x_{t}$$. It can be shown that the periodogram and autocovarinace function are related and the periodogram can be written in terms of the sample autocovariance function for any non-zero Fourier frequency $$ω_{j}$$ :[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-4]

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-4]: The proof is given in BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2006).

$$
  I(\omega_{j}) = \sum_{| k | < n}^{\ }{\widehat{\gamma}( k)}_{\ }e^{- ik\omega_{j}} = {\widehat{\gamma}( 0)}_{\ } + 2\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1}{\widehat{\gamma}( k)\cos{(k\omega_{j})}}_{\ }
  $$

and for the zero frequency $\ I( 0) = n| \overline{x} |^{2}$.

Once comparing \[15\] with an expression for the spectral density of a stationary process:

$$
f(\omega_{\ }) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{k < - \infty}^{\infty}{\gamma( k)}_{\ }e^{- ik\omega_{\ }} = \frac{1}{2\pi}lbrack {\gamma( 0)}_{\ } + 2(\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}{\gamma( k)\cos{(k\omega_{\ })}}) rbrack
$$

It can be noticed that the periodogram is a sample analog of the population spectrum. In fact, it can be shown that the periodogram is asymptotically unbiased but inconsistent estimator of the population spectrum $f(\omega)$.\[\^75\] Therefore, the periodogram is a wildly fluctuating, with high variance, estimate of the spectrum. However, the consistent estimator can be achieved by applying the different linear smoothing filters to the periodogram, called lag-window estimators. The lag-window estimators implemented in JDemetra+ includes square, Welch, Tukey, Barlett, Hanning and Parzen. They are described in DE ANTONIO, D., and PALATE, J. (2015). Alternatively, the model-based consistent estimation procedure, resulting in autoregressive spectrum estimator, can be applied.

### Method 2: Autoregressive spectrum estimation

BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2006) point out that for any real-valued stationary process $(x_{t})$ with continuous spectral density $f(\omega)$ it is possible to find both $AR(p)$ and $MA(q)$ processes which spectral densities are arbitrarily close to $f(\omega)$. For this reason, in some sense, $(x_{t})$ can be approximated by either $AR(p)$ or $MA(q)$ process. This fact is a basis of one of the methods of achieving a consistent estimator of the spectrum, which is called an autoregressive spectrum estimation. It is based on the approximation of the stochastic process $(x_{t})$ by an autoregressive process of sufficiently high order $p$:

$$
  x_{t} = \mu + (\phi_{1}B + \ldots + \phi_{p}B^{p})x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}
  $$

where $$\varepsilon_{t}$$ is a white-noise variable with mean zero and a constant variance.

The autoregressive spectrum estimator for the series $x_{t}$ is defined as: [^17-meth-spectral_analysis-10]

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-10]: Definition from '*X-12-ARIMA Reference Manual*' (2011).

$$
 \widehat{s}(\omega) = 10\operatorname{\times}{\log_{10}\frac{\sigma_{x}^{2}}{2\pi{|1 - \sum_{k = 1}^{p}{\widehat{\phi}}_{k}e^{- ik\omega}|}^{2}}}
 $$

where:

$\omega$-- frequency, $0 \leq \omega \leq \pi$;

$\sigma_{x}^{2}$ -- the innovation variance of the sample residuals;

$${\widehat{\phi}}_{k}$$ -- $\text{AR}(k)$ coefficient estimates of the linear regression of $x_{t} - \overline{x}$ on $x_{t - k} - \overline{x}$, $1 \leq k \leq p$.

The autoregressive spectrum estimator is used in the visual spectral analysis tool for detecting significant peaks in the spectrum. The criterion of *visual significance*, implemented in JDemetra+, is based on the range ${\widehat{s}}^{\max} - {\widehat{s}}^{\min}$ of the $\widehat{s}(\omega)$ values, where ${\widehat{s}}^{\max} = \max_{k}\widehat{s}(\omega_{k})$; ${\widehat{s}}^{\min} = \min_{k}\widehat{s}(\omega_{k});$ and \$\widehat{s}(\omega\_{k})\$is $k^{\text{th}}$ value of autoregressive spectrum estimator.

The particular value is considered to be visually significant if, at a trading day or at a seasonal frequency $\omega_{k}$ (other than the seasonal frequency $\omega_{60} = \pi$), \$\widehat{s}(\omega\_{k})\$is above the median of the plotted values of $\widehat{s}(\omega_{k})$ and is larger than both neighbouring values $\widehat{s}(\omega_{k - 1})$ and $\widehat{s}(\omega_{k + 1})$ by at least $\frac{6}{52}$ times the range ${\widehat{s}}^{\max} - {\widehat{s}}^{\min}$.

Following the suggestion of SOUKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999), JDemetra+ uses an autoregressive model spectral estimator of model order 30. This order yields high resolution of strong components, meaning peaks that are sharply defined in the plot of $\widehat{s}(\omega)$ with 61 frequencies. The minimum number of observations needed to compute the spectrum is set to $n=80$ for monthly data and to $n =$ 60 for quarterly series while the maximum number of observations considered for the estimation is 121. Consequently, with these settings it is possible to identify up to 30 peaks in the plot of 61 frequencies. By choosing $\omega_{k} = \frac{\text{πk}}{60}$ for \$k = \$0,1,...,60 the density estimates are calculated at exact seasonal frequencies (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year).

The model order can also be selected based on the AIC criterion (in practice it is much lower than 30). A lower order produces the smoother spectrum, but the contrast between the spectral amplitudes at the trading day frequencies and neighbouring frequencies is weaker, and therefore not as suitable for automatic detection.

SOUKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999) also explain that the periodogram can be used in the *visual significance* test as it has as good as those of the AR(30) spectrum abilities to detect trading day effect, but also has a greater false alarm rate[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-11].

[^17-meth-spectral_analysis-11]: The false alarm rate is defined as the fraction of the 50 replicates for which a visually significant spectral peak occurred at one of the trading day frequencies being considered in the designated output spectra (SOUKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999)).

### Method 3: Tukey spectrum 





## Identification of spectral peaks

Identification of seasonal peaks in a Tukey periodogram and in an autoregressive spectrum

In order to decide whether a series has a seasonal component that is
predictable (stable) enough, these tests use visual criteria and formal
tests for the periodogram. The periodogram is calculated using complete
years, so that the set of Fourier frequencies contains exactly all
seasonal frequencies[^85].

The tests rely on two basic principles:

-   The peaks associated with seasonal frequencies should be larger than the median spectrum for all frequencies and;

-   The peaks should exceed the spectrum of the two adjacent values by more than a critical value.

The calendar (trading day or working day) effects, related to the
variation in the number of different days of the week per period, can
induce periodic patterns in the data that can be similar to those
resulting from pure seasonal effects. From the theoretical point of
view, trading day variability is mainly due to the fact that the average
number of days in the months or quarters is not equal to a multiple of
7 (the average number of days of a month in the year of 365.25 days
is equal to $\frac{365.25}{12} =$ 30.4375 days). This effect occurs
$\frac{365.25}{12} \times \frac{1}{7} =$ 4.3482 times per month: one
time for each one of the four complete weeks of each month, and a
residual of 0.3482 cycles per month, i.e.
$0.3482 \times 2\pi = 2.1878$ radians. This turns out to be a
fundamental frequency for the effects associated with monthly data. In
JDemetra+ the fundamental frequency corresponding to 0.3482 cycles per
month is used in place of the closest frequency $\frac{\text{πk}}{60}$.
Thus, the quantity $\frac{\pi \times 42}{60}$ is replaced
by $\omega_{42} = 0.3482 \times 2\pi = 2.1878$. The frequencies
neighbouring $\omega_{42}$, i.e. $\omega_{41}$ and $\omega_{43}$ are set
to, respectively, $2.1865 - \frac{1}{60}$ and $2.1865 + \frac{1}{60}$.

The default frequencies ($d)\ $for calendar effect are: 2.188 (monthly
series) and 0.280 (quarterly series). They are computed as:

 $$
 \omega_{\text{ce}} = \frac{2\pi}{7}\left( n - 7 \times \left\lbrack \frac{n}{7} \right\rbrack \right)
 $$, \[1\] <!---\[7.158\]      -->  

where:

$n = \frac{365.25}{s}$, $s = 4$ for quarterly series and $s = 12$ for
monthly series.

Other frequencies that correspond to trading day frequencies are: 2.714
(monthly series) and 1.292, 1.850, 2.128 (quarterly series).

In particular, the calendar frequency in monthly data (marked in red on the figure below) is very close to the seasonal frequency corresponding to 4
cycles per year $\text{ω}_{40} = \frac{2}{3}\pi = 2.0944$.

This implies that it may be hard to disentangle both effects using the
frequency domain techniques.

## Spectral graphs 

comment3: start part case studies > spectral graphs

This scenario is designed for advanced users interested in an in-depth analysis of
time series in the frequency domain using three spectral graphs. Those
graphs can also be used as a complementary analysis for a better
understanding of the results obtained with some of the tests described
above.

Economic time series are usually presented in a time domain (X-axis).
However, for analytical purposes it is convenient to convert the
series to a frequency domain due to the fact that any stationary time
series can be expressed as a combination of cosine (or sine) functions.
These functions are characterized with different periods (amount of time
to complete a full cycle) and amplitudes (maximum/minimum value during
the cycle).

The tool used for the analysis of a time series in a frequency domain is
called a spectrum. The peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of
cyclical movements with periodicity between two months and one year. A seasonal
series should have peaks at the seasonal
frequencies. Calendar adjusted data are not expected to have peak at with a
calendar frequency.

The periodicity of the phenomenon at frequency *f* is $\frac{2\pi}{f}$. It
means that for a monthly time series the seasonal frequencies
$\frac{\pi}{6},\ \frac{\pi}{3},\ \frac{\pi}{2},\ \frac{2\pi}{3},\ \frac{5\pi}{6}\ $
and $\pi$ correspond to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year. For
example, the frequency $\frac{\pi}{3}$ corresponds to a periodicity of 6
months (2 cycles per year are completed). For the quarterly series there
are two seasonal frequencies: $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (one cycle per year) and
$\pi$ (two cycles per year). A peak at the zero frequency always
corresponds to the trend component of the series. Seasonal frequencies
are marked as grey vertical lines, while violet vertical lines represent the
trading-days frequencies. The trading day frequency is 0.348 and derives
from the fact that a daily component which repeats every seven days goes
through 4.348 cycles in a month of average length 30.4375 days. It is
therefore seen to advance 0.348 cycles per month when the data are
obtained at twelve equally spaced times in 365.25 days (the average
length of a year).

The interpretation of the spectral graph is rather straightforward. When
the values of a spectral graph for low frequencies (i.e. one year and
more) are large in relation to its other values it means that the
long-term movements dominate in the series. When the values of a
spectral graph for high frequencies (i.e. below one year) are large in
relation to its other values it means that the series are rather
trendless and contains a lot of noise. When the values of a spectral
graph are distributed randomly around a constant without any visible
peaks, then it is highly probable that the series is a random process.
The presence of seasonality in a time series is manifested in a spectral
graph by the peaks on the seasonal frequencies.
