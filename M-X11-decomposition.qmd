# X-11 decomposition {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

A complete documentation of the X-11 method is available in LADIRAY, D.,
and QUENNEVILLE, B. (2001). The X-11 program is the result of a long
tradition of non-parametric smoothing based on moving averages, which
are weighted averages of a moving span of a time series (see hereafter).
Moving averages have two important drawbacks:

-   They are not resistant and might be deeply impacted by outliers;

-   The smoothing of the ends of the series cannot be done except with
    asymmetric moving averages which introduce phase-shifts and delays
    in the detection of turning points.

These drawbacks adversely affect the X-11 output and stimulate the
development of this method. To overcome these flaws first the series are
modelled with a RegARIMA model that calculates forecasts and estimates
the regression effects. Therefore, the seasonal adjustment process is
divided into two parts.

-   In a first step, the RegARIMA model is used to clean the series from
    non-linearities, mainly outliers and calendar effects. A global
    ARIMA model is adjusted to the series in order to compute the
    forecasts.

-   In a second step, an enhanced version of the X-11 algorithm is used
    to compute the trend, the seasonal component and the irregular
    component.

#### Moving averages

The moving average of coefficient $\theta_{i}$ is defined as:

$$
M\left( X_{t} \right) = \sum_{k = - p}^{+ f}\theta_{k}X_{t + k}
$$

$$
1
$$<!---\[7.61\]-->


The value at time $t$ of the series is therefore replaced by a weighted
average of $p$ "past" values of the series, the current value, and $f$
"future" values of the series. The quantity $p + f + 1$ is called the
moving average order. When $p$ is equal to $f$, that is, when the number
of points in the past is the same as the number of points in the future,
the moving average is said to be centred. If, in addition,
$\theta_{- k} = \theta_{k}$ for any $k$, the moving average $M$ is said
to be symmetric. One of the simplest moving averages is the symmetric
moving average of order $P = 2p + 1$ where all the weights are equal
to $\frac{1}{P}$.

This moving average formula works well for all time series observations,
except for the first $p$ values and last $f$ values. Generally, with a
moving average of order $p + f + 1$ calculated for instant $t$ nwith
points $p$ in the past and points $f$ in the future, it will be
impossible to smooth out the first $p$ values and the last $f$ values of
the series because of lack of input to the moving average formula.

In the X-11 method, symmetric moving averages play an important role as
they do not introduce any phase-shift in the smoothed series. But, to
avoid losing information at the series ends, they are either
supplemented by *ad hoc* asymmetric moving averages or applied on the
series extended by forecasts.

For the estimation of the seasonal component, X-13ARIMA-SEATS uses
$P \times Q$ composite moving averages, obtained by composing a simple
moving average of order $P$, which coefficients are all equal to
$\frac{1}{P}$, and a simple moving average of order $Q$, which
coefficients are all equal to $\frac{1}{Q}$.

The composite moving averages are widely used by the X-11 method. For an
initial estimation of trend X-11 method uses a $2 \times 4$ moving
average in case of a quarterly time series while for a monthly time
series a $2 \times 12$ moving average is applied. The $2 \times 4$
moving average is an average of order 5 with coefficients
$\frac{1}{8}\left\{1, 2, 2, 2, 1\right\}$. It eliminates frequency
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ corresponding to period 4 and therefore it is suitable
for seasonal adjustment of the quarterly series with a constant
seasonality. The $2 \times 12$ moving average, with coefficients
$\frac{1}{24}\left\{1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1\right\}$ that
retains linear trends, eliminates order-$12$ constant seasonality and
minimises the variance of the irregular component. The $2 \times 4$ and
$2 \times 12$ moving averages are also used in the X-11 method to
normalise the seasonal factors. The composite moving averages are also
used to extract the seasonal component. These, which are used in the
purely automatic run of the X-11 method (without any intervention from
the user) are $3 \times 3$, $3 \times 5$ and $3 \times 9$.

In the estimation of the trend also Henderson moving averages are used.
These filters have been chosen for their smoothing properties. The
coefficients of a Henderson moving average of order $2p + 1$ may be
calculated using the formula:

$$
\theta_{i} = \frac{315\left\lbrack \left( n - 1 \right)^{2} - i^{2} \right\rbrack\left\lbrack n^{2} - i^{2} \right\rbrack\left\lbrack \left( n + 1 \right)^{2} - i^{2} \right\rbrack\left\lbrack {3n}^{2} - 16 - 11i^{2} \right\rbrack}{8n\left( n^{2} - 1 \right)\left( {4n}^{2} - 1 \right)\left( {4n}^{2} - 9 \right)\left( 4n^{2} - 25 \right)}
$$,

$$

where: $n = p + 2$$n = p + 2$.

#### The basic algorithm of the X-11 method

The X-11 method is based on an iterative principle of estimation of the
different components using appropriate moving averages at each step of
the algorithm. The successive results are saved in tables. The list of
the X-11 tables displayed in JDemetra+ is included at the end of this
section.

The basic algorithm of the X-11 method will be presented for a monthly
time series $X_{t}$ that is assumed to be decomposable into trend,
seasonality and irregular component according to an additive model
$X_{t} = TC_{t} + S_{t} + I_{t}$.

A simple seasonal adjustment algorithm can be thought of in eight steps.
The steps presented below are designed for the monthly time series. In
the algorithm that is run for the quarterly time series the $2 \times 4$
moving average instead of the $2 \times 12$ moving average is used.

***Step 1: Estimation of Trend by*** $\mathbf{2 \times 12}$ ***moving
average:***

$$
TC_{t}^{(1)} = M_{2 \times 12}(X_{t})
$$

$$
3
$$<!---\[7.63\]-->

***Step 2: Estimation of the Seasonal-Irregular component:***

$$
\left( S_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(1)} = X_{t} - \text{TC}_{t}^{(1)}
$$

$$
4
$$<!---\[7.64\]-->

***Step 3: Estimation of the Seasonal component by***
$$
\mathbf{3 \times 3}
$$ ***moving average over each month:***

$$
S_{t}^{(1)} - M_{3 \times 3}\left\lbrack \left( S_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(1)} \right\rbrack
$$

$$
5
$$<!---\[7.65\]-->

The moving average used here is a $3 \times 3$ moving average over $5$
terms, with coefficients $\frac{1}{9} \left\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1 \right\}$.
The seasonal component is then centred using a $2 \times 12$ moving
average.

$$
\widetilde{S}_{t}^{(1)} = S_{t}^{(1)} - M_{2 \times 12}\left( S_{t}^{(1)} \right)
$$

$$
6
$$<!---\[7.66\]-->

***Step 4: Estimation of the seasonally adjusted series:***

$$
SA_{t}^{\left( 1 \right)} = \left( \text{TC}_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(1)} = X_{t} - {\widetilde{S}}_{t}^{(1)}
$$

$$
7
$$<!---\[7.67\]-->

This first estimation of the seasonally adjusted series must, by
construction, contain less seasonality. The X-11 method again executes
the algorithm presented above, changing the moving averages to take this
property into account.

***Step 5: Estimation of Trend by 13-term Henderson moving average:***

$$
TC_{t}^{(2)} = H_{13}\left( \text{SA}_{t}^{\left( 1 \right)} \right)
$$

$$
8
$$<!---\[7.68\]-->

Henderson moving averages, while they do not have special properties in
terms of eliminating seasonality (limited or none at this stage), have a
very good smoothing power and retain a local polynomial trend of degree
$2$ and preserve a local polynomial trend of degree $3$.

***Step 6: Estimation of the Seasonal-Irregular component:***

$$
\left( S_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(2)} = X_{t} - \text{TC}_{t}^{(2)}
$$

$$
9
$$<!---\[7.69\]-->

***Step 7: Estimation of the Seasonal component by***
$\mathbf{3 \times 5}$ ***moving average over each month:***

$$
S_{t}^{(2)} - M_{3 \times 3}\left\lbrack \left( S_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(2)} \right\rbrack
$$

$$
10
$$<!---\[7.70\]-->

The moving average used here is a $3 \times 5$ moving average over $7$
terms, of coefficients
$$
\frac{1}{15} \left\{ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 3,\ 3,\ 2,\ 1 \right\}
$$ and retains
linear trends. The coefficients are then normalised such that their sum
over the whole $12$-month period is approximately cancelled out:

$$
{ \widetilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)} = S_{t}^{(2)} - M_{2 \times 12}\left( S_{t}^{(2)} \right)
$$

$$
11
$$<!---\[7.71\]-->

***Step 8: Estimation of the seasonally adjusted series:***

$$
SA_{t}^{\left( 2 \right)} = \left(TC_{t} + I_{t} \right)^{(2)} = X_{t} - {\widetilde{S}}_{t}^{(2)}
$$

$$
12
$$<!---\[7.72\]-->

The whole difficulty lies, then, in the choice of the moving averages
used for the estimation of the trend in steps $1$ and $5$ on the one
hand, and for the estimation of the seasonal component in steps $3$ and
$5$. The course of the algorithm in the form that is implemented in
JDemetra+ is presented in the figure below. The adjustment for trading
day effects, which is present in the original X-11 program, is omitted
here, as since calendar correction is performed by the RegARIMA model,
JDemetra+ does not perform further adjustment for these effects in the
decomposition step.

from the Deutsche Bundesbank**

##### **The iterative principle of X-11**

To evaluate the different components of a series, while taking into
account the possible presence of extreme observations, X-11 will proceed
iteratively: estimation of components, search for disruptive effects in
the irregular component, estimation of components over a corrected
series, search for disruptive effects in the irregular component, and so
on.

The Census X-11 program presents four processing stages (A, B, C, and
D), plus 3 stages, E, F, and G, that propose statistics and charts and
are not part of the decomposition per se. In stages B, C and D the basic
algorithm is used as is indicated in the figure below.

**A workflow diagram for the X-11 algorithm implemented in JDemetra+.
Source: Based upon training material from the Deutsche Bundesbank**

-   **Part A: Pre-adjustments**

This part, which is not obligatory, corresponds in X-13ARIMA-SEATS to
the first cleaning of the series done using the RegARIMA facilities:
detection and estimation of outliers and calendar effects (trading day
and Easter), forecasts and backcasts[\^61] of the series. Based on these
results, the program calculates prior adjustment factors that are
applied to the raw series. The series thus corrected, Table B1 of the
printouts, then proceeds to part B.

-   **Part B: First automatic correction of the series**

This stage consists of a first estimation and down-weighting of the
extreme observations and, if requested, a first estimation of the
calendar effects. This stage is performed by applying the basic
algorithm detailed earlier. These operations lead to Table B20,
adjustment values for extreme observations, used to correct the
unadjusted series and result in the series from Table C1.

-   **Part C: Second automatic correction of the series**

Applying the basic algorithm once again, this part leads to a more
precise estimation of replacement values of the extreme observations
(Table C20). The series, finally "cleaned up", is shown in Table D1 of
the printouts.

-   **Part D: Seasonal adjustment**

This part, at which our basic algorithm is applied for the last time, is
that of the seasonal adjustment, as it leads to final estimates:

-   of the seasonal component (Table D10);

-   of the seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   of the trend component (Table D12);

-   of the irregular component (Table D13).

<!-- -->

-   **Part E: Components modified for large extreme values**

Parts E includes:

-   Components modified for large extreme values;

-   Comparison the annual totals of the raw time series and seasonally
    adjusted time series;

-   Changes in the final seasonally adjusted series;

-   Changes in the final trend;

-   Robust estimation of the final seasonally adjusted series.

The results from part E are used in part F to calculate the quality
measures.

-   **Part F: Seasonal adjustment quality measures**

Part F contains statistics for judging the quality of the seasonal
adjustment. JDemetra+ presents selected output for part F, i.e.:

-   M and Q statistics;

-   Tables.

<!-- -->

-   **Part G: Graphics**

Part G presents spectra estimated for:

-   Raw time series adjusted a priori (Table B1);

-   Seasonally adjusted time series modified for large extreme values
    (Table E2);

-   Final irregular component adjusted for large extreme values (Table
    E3).

Originally, graphics were displayed in character mode. In JDemetra+,
these graphics are replaced favourably by the usual graphics software.

**The Henderson moving average and the trend estimation**

In iteration B (Table B7), iteration C (Table C7) and iteration D (Table
D7 and Table D12) the trend component is extracted from an estimate of
the seasonally adjusted series using Henderson moving averages. The
length of the Henderson filter is chosen automatically by
X-13ARIMA-SEATS in a two-step procedure.

It is possible to specify the length of the Henderson moving average to
be used. X-13ARIMA-SEATS provides an automatic choice between a 9-term,
a 13-term or a 23-term moving average. The automatic choice of the order
of the moving average is based on the value of an indicator called
$\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio which compares the magnitude
of period-on-period movements in the irregular component with those in
the trend. The larger the ratio, the higher the order of the moving
average selected. Moreover, X-13ARIMA-SEATS allows the user to choose
manually any odd‑numbered Henderson moving average. The procedure used
in each part is very similar; the only differences are the number of
options available and the treatment of the observations in the both ends
of the series. The procedure below is applied for a monthly time series.

In order to calculate $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio a first
decomposition of the SA series (seasonally adjusted) is computed using a
13-term Henderson moving average.

For both the trend ($C$) and irregular ($I$) components, the average of
the absolute values for monthly growth rates (multiplicative model) or
for monthly growth (additive model) are computed. They are denoted as
$\overline{C}$ and $\overline{I}$, receptively, where
$\overline{C} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{n}\left| C_{t} - C_{t - 1} \right|$
and
$\overline{I} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{n}\left| I_{t} - I_{t - 1} \right|$.

Then the value of $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio is checked
and in iteration B:

-   If the ratio is smaller than 1, a 9-term Henderson moving average is
    selected;

-   Otherwise, a 13-term Henderson moving average is selected.

Then the trend is computed by applying the selected Henderson filter to
the seasonally adjusted series from Table B6. The observations at the
beginning and at the end of the time series that cannot be computed by
means of symmetric Henderson filters are estimated by ad hoc asymmetric
moving averages.

In iterations C and D:

-   If the ratio is smaller than 1, a 9-term Henderson moving average is
    selected;

-   If the ratio is greater than 3.5, a 23-term Henderson moving average
    is selected.

-   Otherwise, a 13-term Henderson moving average is selected.

The trend is computed by applying selected Henderson filter to the
seasonally adjusted series from Table C6, Table D7 or Table D12,
accordingly. At the both ends of the series, where a central Henderson
filter cannot be applied, the asymmetric ends weights for the 7 term
Henderson filter are used.

##### **Choosing the composite moving averages when estimating the seasonal component**

In iteration D, Table D10 shows an estimate of the seasonal factors
implemented on the basis of the modified SI (Seasonal -- Irregular)
factors estimated in Tables D4 and D9bis. This component will have to be
smoothed to estimate the seasonal component; depending on the importance
of the irregular in the SI component, we will have to use moving
averages of varying length as in the estimate of the Trend/Cycle where
the $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio was used to select the
length of the Henderson moving average. The estimation includes several
steps.

***Step 1: Estimating the irregular and seasonal components***

An estimate of the seasonal component is obtained by smoothing, month by
month and therefore column by column, Table D9bis using a simple 7-term
moving average, i.e. of coefficients
$\frac{1}{7} \left\{1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1\right\}$. In order not
to lose three points at the beginning and end of each column, all
columns are completed as follows. Let us assume that the column that
corresponds to the month is composed of $N$ values $\left\{ x_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots x_{N - 1},\ x_{N} \right\}$.
It will be transformed into a series $\left\{ {x_{- 2},x_{- 1}{,x}_{0},x}_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots x_{N - 1},\ x_{N},x_{N + 1},\ x_{N + 1},\ x_{N + 2},\ x_{N + 3} \right\}$
with $x_{- 2} = x_{- 1} = x_{0} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}}{3}$ and
$x_{N + 1} = x_{N + 2} = x_{N + 3} = \frac{x_{N} + x_{N - 1} + x_{N - 2}}{3}$.
We then have the required estimates: $S = M_{7}(D9bis)$ and
$I = D9bis - S$.

***Step 2: Calculating the Moving Seasonality Ratios***

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month the mean annual changes for each
component is obtained by calculating
$$
{\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}\left| S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1} \right|
$$
and
$$
{\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}\left| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1} \right|
$$,
where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$in the data, and
the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$:
$$
MSR_{i} = \frac{\ {\overline{I}}_{i}}{ {\overline{S}}_{i}}
$$. These
ratios are presented in *Details* of the *Quality Measures* node under
the *Decomposition (X11)* section. These ratios are used to compare the
year-on-year changes in the irregular component with those in the
seasonal component. The idea is to obtain, for each month, an indicator
capable of selecting the appropriate moving average for the removal of
any noise and providing a good estimate of the seasonal factor. The
higher the ratio, the more erratic the series, and the greater the order
of the moving average should be used. As for the rest, by default the
program selects the same moving average for each month, but the user can
select different moving averages for each month.

***Step 3: Calculating the overall Moving Seasonality Ratio***

The overall Moving Seasonality Ratio is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{MSR}_{i} = \frac{\sum_{i}^{}{N_{i}\ }\ {\overline{I}}_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{}N_{i}{\overline{S}}_{i}}
$$

$$
13
$$<!---\[7.73\]-->

***Step 4: Selecting a moving average and estimating the seasonal
component***

Depending on the value of the ratio, the program automatically selects a
moving average that is applied, column by column (i.e. month by month)
to the Seasonal/Irregular component in Table D8 modified, for extreme
values, using values in Table D9.

The default selection procedure of a moving average is based on the
Moving Seasonality Ratio in the following way:

-   If this ratio occurs within zone A (MSR \< 2.5), a $3 \times 3$
    moving average is used; if it occurs within zone C (3.5 \< MSR \<
    5.5), a $3 \times 5$ moving average is selected; if it occurs within
    zone E (MSR  6.5), a $3 \times 9$ moving average is used;

-   If the MSR occurs within zone B or D, one year of observations is
    removed from the end of the series, and the MSR is recalculated.
    If the ratio again occurs within zones B or D, we start over
    again, removing a maximum of five years of observations. If this
    does not work, i.e. if we are again within zones B or D, a
    $3 \times 5$ moving average is selected.

The chosen symmetric moving average corresponds, as the case may be 5
($3 \times 3$), 7 ($3 \times 5$) or 11 ($3 \times 9$ $3 \times 9$) terms,
and therefore does not provide an estimate for the values of seasonal
factors in the first 2 (or 3 or 5) and the last 2 (or 3 or 5) years.
These are then calculated using associated asymmetric moving averages.

**Moving average selection procedure, source: DAGUM, E. B.(1999)**

##### **Identification and replacement of extreme values**

X-13ARIMA-SEATS detects and removes outliers in the RegARIMA part.
However, if there is a seasonal heteroscedasticity in a time series i.e.
the variance of the irregular component is different in different
calendar months. Examples for this effect could be the weather and
snow-dependent output of the construction sector in Germany during
winter, or changes in Christmas allowances in Germany and resulting from
this a transformation in retail trade turnover before Christmas. The
ARIMA model is not on its own able to cope with this characteristic. The
practical consequence is given by the detection of additional extreme
values by X-11. This may not be appropriate if the seasonal
heteroscedasticity is produced by political interventions or other
influences. The ARIMA models assume a constant variance and are
therefore not by themselves able to cope with this problem. Choosing
longer (in the case of diverging weather conditions in the winter time
for the construction sector) or shorter filters (in the case of a
changing pattern of retail trade turnover in the Christmas time) may be
reasonable in such cases. It may even be sensible to take into account
the possibility of period-specific (e.g. month-specific) standard
deviations, which can be done by changing the default settings of the
**calendarsigma** parameter (see
[Specifications-X13](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html) section). The
value of the **calendarsigma** parameter will have an impact on the
method of calculation of the moving standard deviation in the procedure
for extreme values detection presented below.

***Step 1: Estimating the seasonal component***

The seasonal component is estimated by smoothing the SI component
separately for each period using a $3 \times 3$ moving average, i.e.:

$$
  \frac{1}{9} \times \begin{Bmatrix}
  1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\
  2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\
  3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\
  2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\
  1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\
  \end{Bmatrix}
$$

$$
14
$$<!---\[7.74\]-->

***Step 2: Normalizing the seasonal factors***

The preliminary seasonal factors are normalized in such a way that for
one year their average is equal to zero (additive model) or to unity
(multiplicative model).

***Step 3: Estimating the irregular component***

The initial normalized seasonal factors are removed from the
Seasonal-Irregular component to provide an estimate of the irregular
component.

***Step 4: Calculating a moving standard deviation***

By default, a moving standard deviation of the irregular component is
calculated at five-year intervals. Each standard deviation is associated
with the central year used to calculate it. The values in the central
year, which in the absolute terms deviate from average by more than the
**Usigma** parameter are marked as extreme values and assigned a zero
weight. After excluding the extreme values the moving standard deviation
is calculated once again.

***Step 5: Detecting extreme values and weighting the irregular***

The default settings for assigning a weight to each value of irregular
component are:

-   Values which are more than **Usigma** (2.5, by default) standard
    deviations away (in the absolute terms) from the 0 (additive) or 1
    (multiplicative) are assigned a zero weight;

-   Values which are less than 1.5 standard deviations away (in the
    absolute terms) from the 0 (additive) or 1 (multiplicative) are
    assigned a full weight (equal to one);

-   Values which lie between 1.5 and 2.5 standard deviations away (in
    the absolute terms) from the 0 (additive) or 1 (multiplicative) are
    assigned a weight that varies linearly between 0 and 1 depending on
    their position.

The default boundaries for the detection of the extreme values can be
changed with **LSigma** and **USigma** parameters

***Step 6: Adjusting extreme values of the seasonal-irregular
component***

Values of the SI component are considered extreme when a weight less
than 1 is assigned to their irregular. Those values are replaced by a
weighted average of five values:

-   The value itself with its weight;

-   The two preceding values, for the same period, having a full
    weight(if available);

-   The next two values, for the same period, having full a weight (if
    available).

When the four full-weight values are not available, then a simple
average of all the values available for the given period is taken.

This general algorithm is used with some modification in parts B and C
for detection and replacement of extreme values.

#### Filter length choice

A seasonal filter is a weighted average of a moving span of fixed length
within a time series that can be used to remove a fixed seasonal
pattern. X-13ARIMA-SEATS uses several of these filters, according to the
needs of the different stages of the program. As only X-13ARIMA-SEATS
allows the user to manually select seasonal filters, this case study can
be applied only to the X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications.

The automatic seasonal adjustment procedure uses the default options to
select the most appropriate moving average. However there are occasions
when the user will need to specify a different seasonal moving\
average to that identified by the program. For example, if the SI values
do not closely follow the seasonal component, it may be appropriate to
use a shorter moving average. Also the presence of sudden breaks in the
seasonal pattern -- e.g. due to changes in the methodology -- can
negatively impact on the automatic selection of the most appropriate
seasonal filter. In such cases the usage of short seasonal filters in
the selected months or quarters can be considered. Usually, a shorter
seasonal filter $(3 \times 1)$ allows seasonality to change very rapidly
over time. However, a very short seasonal filter should not normally be
used, as it might often lead to large revisions as new data becomes
available. If a short filter is to be used it will usually be limited to
one month/quarter with a known reason for wanting to capture a rapidly
changing seasonality.

In the standard situation one seasonal filter is applied to all
individual months/quarters. The estimation of seasonal movements is
therefore based on the sample windows of equal lengths for each
individual month/quarter (i.e. for each month/quarter the seasonal
filter length or the number of years representing the major part of the
seasonal filter weights is identical). This approach relies on the
assumption that the number of past periods in which the conditions
causing seasonal behaviour are sufficiently homogenous is the same in
all months/quarters. However, this assumption does not always hold.
Seasonal causes may change in one month, while staying the same in
others[^seasonal-adjustment-16]. For instance, seasonal
heteroskedasticity might require different filter lengths in different
months or quarters.

[^seasonal-adjustment-16]: When the series are non-stationary
    differentiation is performed before the seasonality tests.

Another interesting example is industrial production in Germany. It can
be influenced by school holidays, since many employees have school-age
children, which interrupt their working pattern during these school
holidays. Consequently, businesses may temporarily suspend or lower
production during these periods. Since school holidays do not occur at
the same time throughout Germany and their timing varies from year to
year in the individual federal states, the effect is not completely
captured by seasonal adjustment. And since school holidays are treated
as usual working days, these effects are not captured by calendar
adjustment either. The majority of school holidays in Germany can take
place either in July or in August. This yields higher variances in the
irregular component for these months compared to the rest of the year.
Therefore, in this case a longer seasonal filter is used for these
months to account for this.

Another example might be given by German retail trade. Due to changes in
the consumers' behaviour around Christmas -- possibly more gifts of
money -- the seasonal peak in December has become steadily less
pronounced. To account for this moving seasonality, shorter seasonal
filters in December than during the rest of the year need to be applied.

JDemetra+ offers the options to assign a different seasonal filter
length to each period (month or quarter). The program offers these
options in the *single spec* mode as well as in the *multispec* mode,
albeit they are available only in the *Specifications* window, after a
document is created.





### M-stats

The details about the measures are given below.

-   $M1$ measures the contribution of the irregular component to the total variance. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M2$, which is a very similar to $M1$, is calculated on the basis of the contribution of the irregular component to the stationary portion of the variance. When it is above 1, some changes in an outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M3$ compares the irregular to the trend taken from a preliminary estimate of the seasonally adjusted series. If this ratio is too large, it is difficult to separate the two components from each other. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M4$ tests the randomness of the irregular component. A value above 1 denotes a correlation in the irregular component. In such case a shorter seasonal moving average filter should be considered.

-   $M5$ is used to compare the significance of changes in the trend with that in the irregular. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M6$ checks the $\text{SI}$ (seasonal -- irregular components ratio). If annual changes in the irregular component are too small in relation to the annual changes in the seasonal component, the $3 \times 5$ seasonal filter used for the estimation of the seasonal component is not flexible enough to follow the seasonal movement. In such case a longer seasonal moving average filter should be considered. It should be stressed that $M6$ is calculated only if the $3 \times 5$ filter has been applied in the model.

-   $M7$ is the combined test for the presence of an identifiable seasonality. The test compares the relative contribution of stable and moving seasonality[^m-moving-average-decomposition-1].

-   $M8$ to $M11$ measure if the movements due to the short-term quasi-random variations and movements due to the long-term changes are not changing too much over the years. If the changes are too strong then the seasonal factors could be erroneous. In such case a correction for a seasonal break or the change of the seasonal filter should be considered.

[^m-moving-average-decomposition-1]: See section [Combined seasonality tests](../theory/Tests_combined.html).

The $Q$ statistic is a composite indicator calculated from the $M$ statistics.

Edit : problem with tables display

$$Q = \frac{10M1 + 11M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{100}$$
\[1\]<!---\[5.25\]-->

$Q = Q - M2$ (also called $Q2$) is the $Q$ statistic for which the $M2$ statistics was excluded from the formula, i.e.:

$$Q - M2 = \frac{10M1 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{89}$$
\[2\]<!---\[5.26\]-->

If a time series does not cover at least 6 years, the $M8$, $M9$, $M10$ and $M11$ statistics cannot be calculated. In this case the $Q$ statistic is computed as:

$$Q = \frac{14M1 + 15M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 32M7}{100}$$

The model has a satisfactory quality if the $Q$ statistic is lower than 1.

The tables displayed in the *Quality measures **→** Details* node correspond to the F-set of tables produced by the original X-11 algorithm. To facilitate the analysis of the results, the numbers and the names of the tables are given under each table following the convention used in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).

### Detailed tables

The first table presents the average percent change without regard to sign of the percent changes (multiplicative model) or average differences (additive model) over several periods (from 1 to 12 for a monthly series, from 1 to 4 for a quarterly series) for the following series:

-   $O$ -- Original series (Table A1);

-   $\text{CI}$ -- Final seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   $I$ -- Final irregular component (Table D13);

-   $C$ -- Final trend (Table D12);

-   $S$ -- Final seasonal factors (Table D10);

-   $P$ -- Preliminary adjustment coefficients, i.e. regressors estimated by the RegARIMA model (Table A2);

-   $TD\& H$ -- Final calendar component (Tables A6 and A7);

-   $\text{Mod.O}$ -- Original series adjusted for extreme values (Table E1);

-   $\text{Mod.CI}$ -- Final seasonally adjusted series corrected for extreme values (Table E2);

-   $\text{Mod.I}$ -- Final irregular component adjusted for extreme values (Table E3).

In the case of an additive decomposition, for each component the average absolute changes over several periods are calculated as[^m-moving-average-decomposition-2]:

[^m-moving-average-decomposition-2]: For the multiplicative decomposition the following formula is used: $$
\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}{|\frac{\text{Tabl}e_{t}}{\text{Table}_{t - d}} - 1|}
$$.

$$
\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}|Table_{t} - Table_{t - d}|
$$ \[4\]

where:

$d$ -- time lag in periods (from a monthly time series $d$ varies from to 4 or from 1 to 12);

$n$ -- total number of observations per period;

$\text{Component}$ -- the name of the component;

$\text{Table}$ -- the name of the table that corresponds to the component.

**Table F2A -- changes, in the absolute values, of the principal components**

Next, Table F2B of relative contributions of the different components to the differences (additive model) or percent changes (multiplicative model) in the original series is displayed. They express the relative importance of the changes in each component. Assuming that the components are independent, the following relation is valid:

$$O_{d}^{2} \approx C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$.
\[5\]<!---\[5.29\]-->

In order to simplify the analysis, the approximation can be replaced by the following equation:

$$O_{d}^{*2} = C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$.
\[6\]<!---\[5.30\]--> 

The notation is the same as for Table F2A. The column $\text{Total}$ denotes total changes in the raw time series.

Data presented in Table F2B indicate the relative contribution of each component to the percent changes (differences) in the original series over each span, and are calculated as:

$\frac{I_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$,

$\frac{C_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$,

$\frac{S_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$,

$\frac{P_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$

and $\frac{TD\& H_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$

where: $O_{d}^{*2} = I_{d}^{2} + C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2}{+ TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$.

The last column presents the *Ratio* calculated as:

$100 \times \frac{O_{d}^{*2}}{O_{d}^{2}}$,

which is an indicator of how well the approximation

${(O_{d}^{*})}^{2} \approx O_{d}^{2}$

holds.

**Table F2B -- relative contribution of components to changes in the raw series**

When an additive decomposition is used, Table F2C presents the average and standard deviation of changes calculated for each time lag $d$, taking into consideration the sign of the changes of the raw series and its components. In case of a multiplicative decomposition the respective table shows the average percent differences and related standard deviations.

![Text](All_images/RDimage50.png)

**Table F2C -- Averages and standard deviations of changes as a function of the time lag**

Average duration of run is an average number of consecutive monthly (or quarterly) changes in the same direction (no change is counted as a change in the same direction as the preceding change). JDemetra+ displays this indicator for the seasonally adjusted series, for the trend and for the irregular component.

![Text](All_images/RDimage51.png)

**Table F2D -- Average duration of run**

The $\frac{I}{C}$ ratios for each value of time lag $d$, presented in Table F2E, are computed on a basis of the data in Table F2A.

![Text](All_images/RDimage52.png)

**Table F2E --** $\frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{C}}\mathbf{\ }$ratio for periods span

The relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series is calculated for the irregular component ($I$), trend made stationary[^m-moving-average-decomposition-3] ($C$), seasonal component ($S$) and calendar effects (TD&H). The short description of the calculation method is given in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).

[^m-moving-average-decomposition-3]: The component is estimated by extracting a linear trend from the trend component presented in Table D12.

![Text](All_images/RDimage53.png)

**Table F2F -- Relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series**

The last table shows the autocorrelogram of the irregular component from Table D13. In the case of multiplicative decomposition it is calculated for time lags between 1 and the number of periods per year +2 using the formula[^m-moving-average-decomposition-4]:

[^m-moving-average-decomposition-4]: For the additive decomposition the formula is:
$$
    Corr_{k}I_{t} = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} \times I_{t - k})}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t})}^{2}}
$$

$$
\text{Corr}_{k}I = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)(I_{t - k} - 1)}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)}^{2}}]
$$ \[7\]<!---\[5.31\]-->

where $N$ is number of observations in the time series and $\text{k}$ the lag.

![Text](All_images/RDimage54.png)

**Table F2G -- Autocorrelation of the irregular component**

The Cochran test is design to identify the heterogeneity of a series of variances. X-13-ARIMA-SEATS uses this test in the extreme value detection procedure to check if the irregular component is heteroskedastic. In this procedure the standard errors of the irregular component are used for an identification of extreme values. If the null hypothesis that for all the periods (months, quarters) the variances of the irregular component are identical is rejected, the standard errors will be computed separately for each period (in case the option *Calendarsigma*=**signif** has been selected).

![Text](All_images/RDimage55.png)

**Cochran test**

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month we will be looking at the mean annual changes for each component by calculating:

$$
{\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}|S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1}|
$$

and

$$
{\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1}|
$$,

where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$ in the data, and the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$:

$$
MSR_{i} = \frac{\overline{I}_{i}}{\overline{S}_{i}}
$$

These ratios are published in Table D9A in X13ARIMA-SEATS software. In JDemetra+ they are presented in the details of the quality measures.

The [Moving Seasonality Ratio (MSR)](../theory/SA_X11.html#choosing-the-composite-moving-averages-when-estimating-the-seasonal-component) is used to measure the amount of noise in the Seasonal-Irregular component. By studying these values, the user can [select for each period the seasonal filter](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#seasonal-filter-x11-seasonalma) that is the most suitable given the noisiness of the series.
