# What is JDemetra+? {.unnumbered}

[JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) is an open source software for **seasonal adjustment and time series analysis**, developed by the National Bank of Belgium with the support of the Bundesbank, Insee and the partners of the [COSA](#COSA-abstract) project, co-founded by Eurostat. JDemetra+ has been officially recommended by Eurostat to the members of the European Statistical System since 2015. It is unique in its combination of very fast Java routines, a [**Graphical User Interface**](#t-gui-overview) and an [**ecosystem of R packages (rjdverse)**](https://github.com/rjdverse?view_as=public). The graphical interface provides structured visual feedback suitable for refined analysis and training. R tools allow to combine the capabilities of JDemetra+ with the versatility of the R world, be it for statistical functions or data wrangling.

## Installing the software

The sections below detail how to install JDemetra+ (Graphical user interface and Cruncher) and [how to configure R](#Rconfig) to run rjd3 packages.


### Graphical User Interface (GUI) {#ind-inst-gui}

You can find the latest releases 

- in the v2.x family: [here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases)

To install [v2.2.4](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases/tag/v2.2.4):

- Scroll down the page, download and unzip the file *jdemetra-2.2.4-bin.zip*.

- To start the application, run the file **nbdemetra64.exe** located in the following subfolder [...\\jdemetra-2.2.4-bin\\nbdemetra\\bin]{.path}
 
Remark: You can create shortcuts to the executable files if you want to launch them from another folder (Desktop, project folder...).


- in the v3.x family: [here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/releases)

You should install the latest release available denoted from now on v3.x.y 

- Scroll down the page, download and unzip the file *jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip*, if you use Windows, or the zip corresponding to your OS in the list.

- To start the application, run the file **nbdemetra64.exe** located in the following subfolder [...\\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\\nbdemetra\\bin]{.path}

Version 3.x requires Java 17 or higher, *jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip* contains a portable version of Java, so you don't have to deal with this issue on your computer.

R packages related to version 3.x (rjd3...) also require Java 17 or higher, you can (and should) use the portable version provided with the graphical user interface to run them, this is explained [here](#Rconfig).

### Additional Plug-ins

To benefit from extended features of the graphical user interface installing additional plug-ins is required. The list of available extensions and the installation procedure are detailed [here](#t-plug-ins). How to access the added features in the GUI is described [here](#t-gui-sa).

In the **v2.x family** some of the additional features are:

- Benchmarking and Temporal disaggregation [Plug-in here](https://github.com/nbbrd/jdemetra-benchmarking)
    
- Nowcasting [Plug-in here](https://github.com/nbbrd/jdemetra-nowcasting)
    
In the **v3.x family** some of the additional features are:

- Benchmarking and Temporal disaggregation [Plug-in here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-benchmarking)
    
- Seasonal adjustment of high frequency data [Plug-ins here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator)
    
- Additional algorithms for seasonal adjustment [Plug-ins here](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-incubator)


### Cruncher 

JDemetra+ has an executable module, called the [Cruncher](#t-prod), allowing to automate tasks 

To install it :

- in v2, go to the [**JWSACruncher** page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher), **download** and **unzip** the compressed folder `jwsacruncher-2.2.x-bin.zip`, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.

- in v3, go to the [**jdplus-main** page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main), **download** and **unzip** the compressed folder `jwsacruncher-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip`, corresponding to the version of your Graphical User Interface.

### R packages 

JDemetra+ algorithms can be accessed in R, which is detailed [here](#t-r-packs)

You can directly head over to this [GitHub page](https://github.com/rjdverse?view_as=public), then for each package indications for installation and basic use are provided in the readme files.

<!-- general readme to build and specific to check -->


#### Configuration needed to run rjd3 packages {#Rconfig}

To use rjd3 packages in R, you need Java 17 or higher.

You can (and should) use the version of Java that comes with the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is contained in the file **jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip** available [on this page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/releases), in the "Assets" section, which you might have to expand to be able to see all the files.

Once unzipped, the Java will be in located in  [C:\\Software\\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\\nbdemetra\\jdk-21.0.2+13-jre]{.path} (path to be adapted to your computer/server): this location must be declared in R.

After unzipping the file: 

- run this code at the beginning of your programs


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = ".../jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre")
```

or 

- declare it "permanently" is the Renviron file (where environment variables specific to `R` are stored), following the steps below:

    - in the R console run `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`{.r}

    - in the file that opens add the line :
    ```
    JAVA_HOME = "C:/Software/jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre"
    ```

    - save the file and restart R

Follow R packages installation procedure and run basic examples from the readme files of each package.
They are all listed on [this page](https://github.com/rjdverse?view_as=public) 
    
## COSA project {#COSA-abstract}

The COSA project is composed of two Centres of Excellence (CoE): one on Time Series Analysis (TSA), coordinated by Insee, and one on Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) coordinated by CBS. In a context of development of common tools and methods within the ESS, this action will carry on the work of the STACE project (2020-2024) around three pillars: knowledge sharing and support to practitioners, development and maintenance of bespoke software (JDemetra+ for TSA, τ-ARGUS and sdcMicro for SDC) and methodological guidance (Handbooks, Guidelines, research papers). The overarching goals is to provide user friendly, efficient and technically up-to date tools for statistical production in both fields. 

In the previous project JDemetra+ has undergone a major refactoring with the development of version 3.x providing extensions of TSA algorithms, e.g. seasonal adjustment of high frequency data. The current action will aim at consolidating and completing this new version, by further extending some algorithms, improving technical and user-documentation, uploading R packages on CRAN and adapting JDemetra+ to new IT environments, like cloud infrastructure. 

Τ-ARGUS is considered to be the standard software for table protection. However, τ-ARGUS urgently needs to be modernized. The current project will make a start with developing/designing a modern software architecture for and apply some of the ideas in a proof of concept. The other SDC tools as well as the “old” τ-ARGUS needs to be supported.

Eleven institutions (Insee, CBS, NBB, Istat, INE, Destatis, SURS, HSO, Statistic Austria, Iceland and Norway) are beneficiaries from this grant and will contribute in the aforementioned directions with the collaboration of the Deutsche Bundesbank in TSA. Additional 
institutions will be involved as members of user-groups and observers (ECB, ABS, OECD...).

Results will be presented at workshops and conferences and developments can be followed on dedicated Github repositories.
